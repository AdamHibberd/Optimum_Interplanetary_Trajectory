%-I/O
%
%   Given:
%
%      Parameters-
%
%      SPICE_GF_MAXVRT     is the maximum number of vertices that may be used
%                          to define the boundary of the specified instrument's
%                          field of view. See SpiceGF.h for more details.
%
%      MARGIN              is a small positive number used to constrain the
%                          orientation of the boundary vectors of polygonal
%                          FOVs. Such FOVs must satisfy the following
%                          constraints:
%
%                          1)  The boundary vectors must be contained within
%                              a right circular cone of angular radius less
%                              than than (pi/2) - MARGIN radians; in
%                              other words, there must be a vector A such that
%                              all boundary vectors have angular separation
%                              from A of less than (pi/2)-MARGIN radians.
%
%                          2)  There must be a pair of boundary vectors U, V
%                              such that all other boundary vectors lie in
%                              the same half space bounded by the plane
%                              containing U and V. Furthermore, all other
%                              boundary vectors must have orthogonal
%                              projections onto a specific plane normal to
%                              this plane (the normal plane contains the angle
%                              bisector defined by U and V) such that the
%                              projections have angular separation of at least
%                              2*MARGIN radians from the plane spanned
%                              by U and V.
%
%                          MARGIN is currently set to 1.D-6.
%
%      Arguments-
%
%      inst     indicates the name of an instrument, such as a
%               spacecraft-mounted framing camera. The field of view
%               (FOV) of the instrument will be used to determine if
%               the direction from the observer to a target,
%               represented as a ray, is visible with respect to the
%               instrument.
%
%               [1,a] = size(inst), char = class(inst)
%
%               The position of the instrument is considered to
%               coincide with that of the ephemeris object 'obsrvr' (see
%               description below).
%
%               The size of the instrument's FOV is constrained by the
%               following: There must be a vector A such that all of
%               the instrument's FOV boundary vectors have an angular
%               separation from A of less than (pi/2)-MARGIN radians
%               (see description above). For FOVs that are circular or
%               elliptical, the vector A is the boresight. For FOVs
%               that are rectangular or polygonal, the vector A is
%               calculated.
%
%               See the header of the CSPICE routine getfov_c for a
%               description of the required parameters associated with
%               an instrument.
%
%               Both object names and NAIF IDs are accepted. For
%               example, both 'CASSINI_ISS_NAC' and '-82360' are
%               accepted. Case and leading or trailing blanks are not
%               significant in the string.
%
%      raydir   is the direction vector defining a ray of interest.
%               The ray emanates from the location of the ephemeris
%               object designated by the input argument 'obsrvr' and
%               is expressed relative to the reference frame designated
%               by 'rframe' (see description below).
%
%               [3,1] = size(raydir), double = class(raydir)
%
%      rframe   is the name of the reference frame associated with
%               the input ray's direction vector 'raydir'. Note:
%               'rframe' does not need to be the instrument's reference
%               frame.
%
%               [1,b] = size(rframe), char = class(rframe)
%
%               Since light time corrections are not supported for
%               rays, the orientation of the frame is always evaluated
%               at the epoch associated with the observer, as opposed
%               to the epoch associated with the light-time corrected
%               position of the frame center.
%
%      abcorr   indicates the aberration corrections to be applied
%               when computing the target's position and orientation.
%
%               [1,c] = size(abcorr), char = class(abcorr)
%
%               The supported aberration correction options are:
%
%                 'NONE'          No correction.
%                 'S'             Stellar aberration correction,
%                                 reception case.
%                 'XS'            Stellar aberration correction,
%                                 transmission case.
%
%               For detailed information, see the geometry finder
%               required reading, gf.req.
%
%               Case, leading and trailing blanks are not significant
%               in the string.
%
%      obsrvr   is the name of the body from which the target
%               represented by 'raydir' is observed. The instrument
%               is treated as if it were co-located with the observer.
%
%               [1,d] = size(obsrvr), char = class(obsrvr)
%
%               Both object names and NAIF IDs are accepted. For
%               example, both 'CASSINI' and '-82' are accepted. Case and
%               leading or trailing blanks are not significant in the
%               string.
%
%      et       is the observation time in seconds past the J2000
%               epoch.
%
%               [1,n] = size(et), double = class(et)
%
%   the call:
%
%
%       visibl = cspice_fovray ( inst, raydir,   rframe, ...
%                                abcorr,     obsrvr, et )
%
%   returns:
%
%       visibl  is true if the ray is "visible", or in the
%               field-of-view, of the instrument at the time 'et'.
%               Otherwise, 'visibl' is false.
%
%               [1,n] = size(visibl), logical = class(visibl)

%-Examples
%
%   Any numerical results shown for this example may differ between
%   platforms as the results depend on the SPICE kernels used as input
%   and the machine specific arithmetic implementation.
%
%
%   Example(1):
%
%      The Cassini Ultraviolet Imaging Spectrograph (UVIS)
%      has been used to measure variations in starlight as
%      rings and moons occult Cassini's view of the stars.
%      One of these events happened at 2008-054T21:31:55.158 UTC.
%      Let's verify that Epsilon CMa (Adhara) was in the
%      Cassini UVIS field-of-view at the observation time.

%-Particulars
%
%   To treat the target as an ephemeris object rather than a ray, use

%   instrument's FOV at a given time.
