%
%-I/O
%
%   Given:
%
%      v1   is an arbitrary vector(s).
%
%           [3,n] = size(v1); double = class(v1)
%
%      v2   also an arbitrary vector(s).
%
%           [3,n] = size(v2); double = class(v2)
%
%   the call:
%
%      dist = cspice_vdist(v1, v2)
%
%   returns:
%
%      dist   the value(s) describing the distance(s) between 'v1' and 'v2',
%             distance defined as:
%
%                ||  v1 - v2  ||,
%
%                      _                                               _
%             where || x || indicates the Euclidean norm of the vector x.
%
%             [1,n] = size(dist); double = class(dist)
%
%             'dist' returns with the same vectorization measure, N,
%             as 'v1' and 'v2'.
%
%-Examples
%
%   Any numerical results shown for this example may differ between
%   platforms as the results depend on the SPICE kernels used as input
%   and the machine specific arithmetic implementation.
%
%      %
%      % Define a set of vectors, calculate the distance
%      % between the coordinates.

%      v2 = [1; 0; 0]
%
%      vdist = cspice_vdist( v1, v2 )
