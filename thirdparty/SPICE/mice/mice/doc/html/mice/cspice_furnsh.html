   CSPICE_FURNSH loads SPICE kernel files into MATLAB.

</pre><h4><a name="I/O">I/O</a></h4><pre>

   Given:

      file   the name of a SPICE kernel file. The file may be either binary
             or text. If the file is a binary SPICE kernel it will
             be loaded into the appropriate SPICE subsystem.  If
             'file' is a SPICE text kernel it will be loaded into the
             kernel pool. If 'file' is a SPICE meta-kernel containing
             initialization instructions (through use of the
             correct kernel pool variables), the files specified in
             those variables will be loaded into the appropriate
             SPICE subsystem.

             The SPICE text kernel format supports association of
             names and data values using a &quot;keyword = value&quot;
             format. The keyword-value pairs thus defined are
             called &quot;kernel variables.&quot;

             While any information can be placed in a text kernel
             file, the following string valued kernel variables are
             recognized by SPICE as meta-kernel keywords:

                  KERNELS_TO_LOAD
                  PATH_SYMBOLS
                  PATH_VALUES

             Each kernel variable is discussed below.

             KERNELS_TO_LOAD   is a list of SPICE kernels to be
                               loaded into a program.  If file
                               names do not fit within the kernel
                               pool 80 character limit, they may be
                               continued to subsequent array
                               elements by placing the continuation
                               character ('+') at the end of an
                               element and then placing the
                               remainder of the file name in the
                               next array element.  (See the
                               examples below for an illustration
                               of this technique or consult the
                               routine STPOOL for further details.)

                               You may use one or more PATH_SYMBOL
                               assignments (see below) to specify
                               strings to be substituted for some
                               part of a file name.

             PATH_SYMBOLS      is a list of strings (without
                               embedded blanks) which if
                               encountered following the '$'
                               character will be replaced with the
                               corresponding PATH_VALUES string.
                               Note that PATH_SYMBOLS are
                               interpreted only in values
                               associated with the KERNELS_TO_LOAD
                               variable. There must be a one-to-one
                               correspondence between the values
                               supplied for PATH_SYMBOLS and
                               PATH_VALUES. For the purpose of
                               determining this correspondence, any
                               path value that is continued over
                               multiple array elements counts as a
                               single value.

             PATH_VALUES       is a list of expansions to use when
                               PATH_SYMBOLS are encountered. If
                               path values do not fit within the
                               kernel pool 80 character limit, they
                               may be continued in the same way as
                               file names (see the KERNELS_TO_LOAD
                               description above).

             These kernel pool variables persist within the kernel
             pool only until all kernels associated with the
             variable KERNELS_TO_LOAD have been loaded.  Once all
             specified kernels have been loaded, the variables
             KERNELS_TO_LOAD, PATH_SYMBOLS and PATH_VALUES are
             removed from the kernel pool.

             [n,m] = size(file); char = class(file)

                or

             [1,n] = size(file); cell = class(file)

   the call:

      <b>cspice_furnsh</b>( file )

   loads 'file' into the SPICE kernel system.

</pre><h4><a name="Examples">Examples</a></h4><pre>

   Any numerical results shown for this example may differ between
   platforms as the results depend on the SPICE kernels used as input
   and the machine specific arithmetic implementation.


     Example 1
     ---------

     Load the leapseconds kernel naif0010.tls and the planetary
     ephemeris SPK file de405s.bsp.

        <b>cspice_furnsh</b>( 'naif0010.tls' )
        <b>cspice_furnsh</b>( 'de405s.bsp' )

     Load a vector of kernel names or a cell of kernel names.

        <b>cspice_furnsh</b>( { 'naif0008.tls', 'de405s.bsp' } )

     Example 2
     ---------

     This example illustrates how you could create a meta-kernel file
     for a program that requires several text and binary kernels.

     First create a list of the kernels you need in a text file as
     shown below.

        \begintext

           Here are the SPICE kernels required for my application
           program.

           Note that kernels are loaded in the order listed. Thus we
           need to list the highest priority kernel last.


        \begindata

        KERNELS_TO_LOAD = (

              '/home/mydir/kernels/spk/lowest_priority.bsp',
              '/home/mydir/kernels/spk/next_priority.bsp',
              '/home/mydir/kernels/spk/highest_priority.bsp',
              '/home/mydir/kernels/text/leapsecond.ker',
              '/home/mydir/kernels+',
              '/custom+',
              '/kernel_data/constants.ker',
              '/home/mydir/kernels/text/sclk.tsc',
              '/home/mydir/kernels/ck/c-kernel.bc' )


     Note that the file name

        /home/mydir/kernels/custom/kernel_data/constants.ker

     is continued across several lines in the right hand side of the
     assignment of the kernel variable KERNELS_TO_LOAD.

     Once you've created your list of kernels, call FURNSH near the
     beginning of your application program to load the meta-kernel
     automatically at program start up.

        <b>cspice_furnsh</b>( 'meta.tm' )

     This will cause each of the kernels listed in your meta-kernel
     to be loaded.


     Example 3
     ---------

     This example illustrates how you can simplify the previous
     kernel list by using PATH_SYMBOLS.


        \begintext

           Here are the SPICE kernels required for my application
           program.

           We are going to let A substitute for the directory that
           contains SPK files; B substitute for the directory that
           contains C-kernels; and C substitute for the directory that
           contains text kernels.  And we'll let D substitute for
           a &quot;custom&quot; directory that contains a special planetary
           constants kernel made just for our mission.

           Note that our PATH_VALUES and the corresponding
           PATH_SYMBOLS must be listed in the same order.


        \begindata

        PATH_VALUES  = ( '/home/mydir/kernels/spk',
                         '/home/mydir/kernels/ck',
                         '/home/mydir/kernels/text',
                         '/home/mydir/kernels/custom/kernel_data' )

        PATH_SYMBOLS = ( 'A',
                         'B',
                         'C',
                         'D'  )

        KERNELS_TO_LOAD = (  '$A/lowest_priority.bsp',
                             '$A/next_priority.bsp',
                             '$A/highest_priority.bsp',
                             '$C/leapsecond.ker',
                             '$D/constants.ker',
                             '$C/sclk.tsc',
                             '$B/c-kernel.bc'         )


     Example 4
     ---------

     This example illustrates continuation of path values. The
     meta-kernel shown here is a modified version of that from
     example 3.

        \begintext

           Here are the SPICE kernels required for my application
           program.

           We are going to let A substitute for the directory that
           contains SPK files; B substitute for the directory that
           contains C-kernels; and C substitute for the directory that
           contains text kernels.  And we'll let D substitute for
           a &quot;custom&quot; directory that contains a special planetary
           constants kernel made just for our mission.

           Note that our PATH_VALUES and the corresponding
           PATH_SYMBOLS must be listed in the same order.

           The values for path symbols A and D are continued over
           multiple lines.

        \begindata

        PATH_VALUES  = ( '/very_long_top_level_path_name/mydir/+',
                         'kernels/spk',
                         '/home/mydir/kernels/ck',
                         '/home/mydir/kernels/text',
                         '/very_long_top_level_path_name+',
                         '/mydir/kernels/custom+',
                         '/kernel_data'                )

        PATH_SYMBOLS = ( 'A',
                         'B',
                         'C',
                         'D'  )

        KERNELS_TO_LOAD = (  '$A/lowest_priority.bsp',
                             '$A/next_priority.bsp',
                             '$A/highest_priority.bsp',
                             '$C/leapsecond.ker',
                             '$D/constants.ker',
                             '$C/sclk.tsc',
                             '$B/c-kernel.bc'         )

</pre><h4><a name="Particulars">Particulars</a></h4><pre>

   Text kernels input to this routine need not have native line
   terminators for the platform. Lower level CSPICE routines can
   read and process non-native text files. This functionality does
   not exist in the FORTRAN SPICELIB.

   Kernel pool variable names are restricted to a length of 32
   characters or less.

   In this version of the toolkit the maximum number of kernels that
   can loaded together is limited to 5300. Each time a kernel is loaded
   via <b>cspice_furnsh</b>, an internal kernel database entry is created for
   that kernel. If a meta-kernel is loaded, a database entry is created
   for the meta-kernel itself and for all files referenced in the
   meta-kernel's KERNELS_TO_LOAD specification. Unloading a kernel or
   meta-kernel deletes database entries created when the file was
   loaded.
 
   The value above is an upper bound on number of SPICE kernels that
   can be loaded at any time via <b>cspice_furnsh</b>, but the number of
   kernels that can be loaded may be smaller, since re-loading a loaded
   kernel or meta-kernel results in creation of additional database
   entries.
 
   Kernels loaded via <b>cspice_furnsh</b> are subject to constraints imposed
   by lower-level subsystems. The binary kernel systems (SPK, CK,
   binary PCK, EK, and DSK) have their own limits on the maximum number
   of kernels that may be loaded.
 
   The total number of DAF-based files (this set includes SPKs, CKs,
   and binary PCKs) and DAS-based files (this set includes EKs and
   DSKs) that may be loaded at any time may not exceed 5000. This limit
   applies whether the files are loaded via <b>cspice_furnsh</b> or
   lower-level loaders such as <a href="cspice_dafopr.html">cspice_dafopr</a>. File access performance
   normally will degrade slightly as the number of loaded kernels
   increases.
