%-I/O
%
%   Given:
%
%      None.
%
%   the call:
%
%      tyear = cspice_tyear
%
%   returns:
%
%      tyear   the number of seconds per tropical year. This value is
%              taken from the 1992 Explanatory Supplement to the
%              Astronomical Almanac.
%
%              [1,n] = size(tyear); double = class(tyear)
%
%-Examples
%
%   Any numerical results shown for this example may differ between
%   platforms as the results depend on the SPICE kernels used as input
%   and the machine specific arithmetic implementation.
%
%      >> tyear = cspice_tyear
