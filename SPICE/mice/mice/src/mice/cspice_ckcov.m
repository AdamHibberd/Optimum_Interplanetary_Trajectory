%-I/O
%
%   Given:
%
%      ck        the name(s) of SPICE CK files.
%
%                [n,c1] = size(ck), char = class(ck)
%
%                  or
%
%                [1,n] = size(ck), cell = class(ck)
%
%      idcode    the CK ID code of an object, normally a spacecraft
%                structure or instrument, for which pointing data are
%                expected to exist in the specified CK file.
%
%                [1,1] = size(idcode), int32 = class(idcode)
%
%      needav    a flag indicating whether to consider segments
%                having angular velocity when determining coverage. When
%                'needav' is true, segments without angular velocity don't
%                contribute to the coverage window; when 'needav' is false,
%                all segments for 'idcode' may contribute to the coverage
%                window.
%
%                [1,1] = size(needav), logical = class(needav)
%
%      level     the string defining the level (granularity) at which
%                the coverage is examined.
%
%                [1,c] = size(level), char = class(level)
%
%                Allowed values and corresponding meanings are:
%
%                     'SEGMENT'    The output coverage window contains
%                                  intervals defined by the start and
%                                  stop times of segments for the object
%                                  designated by 'idcode'.
%
%                     'INTERVAL'   The output coverage window contains
%                                  interpolation intervals of segments
%                                  for the object designated by
%                                  'idcode'.  For type 1 segments, which
%                                  don't have interpolation intervals,
%                                  each epoch associated with a pointing
%                                  instance is treated as a singleton
%                                  interval; these intervals are added
%                                  to the coverage window.
%
%                                  All interpolation intervals are
%                                  considered to lie within the segment
%                                  bounds for the purpose of this
%                                  summary:  if an interpolation
%                                  interval extends beyond the segment
%                                  coverage interval, only its
%                                  intersection with the segment
%                                  coverage interval is considered to
%                                  contribute to the total coverage.
%
%      tol       the tolerance value expressed in ticks of the spacecraft
%                clock associated with 'idcode'. Before each interval is
%                inserted into the coverage window, the interval is
%                intersected with the segment coverage interval, then and
%                if the intersection is non-empty, it is expanded by
%                'tol': the left endpoint of the intersection interval is
%                reduced by and the right endpoint is increased by 'tol'.
%                Adjusted interval 'tol' endpoints, when expressed as
%                encoded SCLK, never are less than zero ticks. Any
%                intervals that overlap as a result of the expansion
%                are merged.
%
%                [1,1] = size(tol), double = class(tol)
%
%                The coverage window returned when tol > 0 indicates the
%                coverage provided by the file to the CK readers cspice_ckgpav
%                and cspice_ckgp when that value of 'tol' is passed to them
%                as an input.
%
%      timsys    the name of the time system to use in the output coverage
%                window. 'timsys' may have the values:
%
%                      'SCLK'    Elements of 'cov' are expressed in
%                                encoded SCLK ("ticks"), where the
%                                clock is associated with the object
%                                designated by 'idcode'.
%
%                      'TDB'     Elements of 'cov' are expressed as
%                                seconds past J2000 TDB.
%
%                [1,c] = size(timsys), char = class(timsys)
%
%      room      the number of intervals for use as a workspace by the
%                routine. This value should equal at least the number of
%                intervals corresponding to 'idcode' in 'ck'.
%
%                [1,1] = size(room), int32 = class(room)
%
%      cover_i   an optional input describing a either an empty window or a
%                window array created from a previous cspice_ckcov call.
%                Inclusion of this window argument results in an output
%                window consisting of a union of the data retrieved from the
%                'ck' kernels and the data in 'cover_i'.
%
%                [2m,1] = size(cover_i), double = class(cover_i)
%
%                   or
%
%                [0,0] = size(cover_i), double = class(cover_i)
%
%   the call:
%
%      cov = cspice_ckcov(ck, idcode, needav, level, tol, timsys, room, cover_i)
%
%         or
%
%      cov = cspice_ckcov(ck, idcode, needav, level, tol, timsys, room)
%
%   returns:
%
%      cov   the window containing the coverage for 'idcode' available from
%            'ck'.  When the coverage level is 'INTERVAL', this is the set
%            of time intervals for which data for 'idcode' are present in
%            the file 'ck', The array 'cov' contains the pairs of
%            endpoints of these intervals.
%
%            [2p,1] = size(cov), double = class(cov)
%
%               or
%
%            [0,1] = size(cov), double = class(cov)
%
%            Each window defined as a pair of endpoints such that:
%
%               window 1 = cover(1:2)
%               window 2 = cover(3:4)
%               window 3 = cover(5:6)
%                           ...
%               window p = cover(2p-1,2p)
%
%            When the coverage 'level' is 'SEGMENT', 'cov' is computed in a
%            manner similar to that described above, but the coverage intervals
%            used in the computation are those of segments rather than
%            interpolation intervals within segments.
%
%            When 'tol' is > 0, the intervals comprising the coverage window for
%            'idcode' are expanded by 'tol' and any intervals overlapping as a
%            result are merged. The resulting window is returned in 'cov'.
%            The expanded window in no case extends beyond the segment bounds
%            in either direction by more than 'tol'.
%
%            The interval endpoints contained in 'cov' are encoded spacecraft
%            clock times if 'timsys' is 'SCLK'; otherwise the times are
%            converted from encoded spacecraft clock to seconds past J2000 TDB.
%
%            'cov' returns an empty set if 'ck' lacks coverage for 'idcode'. If
%            'cover_i' exists in the argument list, 'cov' returns as a union of
%            the coverage data found in 'ck' and the data in 'cover_i'. 'cov'
%            can overwrite 'cover_i'.
%
%-Examples
%
%   Any numerical results shown for this example may differ between
%   platforms as the results depend on the SPICE kernels used as input
%   and the machine specific arithmetic implementation.
%
%   Use a simple function to display the CK IDs found in a CK, or set of
%   CKs, and the time coverage of the data corresponding to those IDs.
%   This example calls both cspice_ckobj and cspice_ckcov. In practice,
%   algorithms using cspice_ckobj will also use cspice_ckcov and
%   vice-versa.
