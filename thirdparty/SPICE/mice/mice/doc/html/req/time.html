<H2> Introduction
</H2><HR ALIGN="LEFT" WIDTH=50% ><P><BR><BR>
   This document describes the software available in the Mice Toolkit for
   manipulating various representations of time. It is your main source for
   general information about calendar based and continuous time systems in
   Mice . For specifics of a particular routine you should consult the
   header of that routine.
<P>
 
   In addition to the discussion of time software, there are two appendices
   to this document. The first provides basic background material on
   various time systems. The second discusses the details of how time
   strings are parsed in the Mice system.
<P>
 
   The Toolkit also supports conversion between spacecraft clock (SCLK) and
   Barycentric Dynamical Time (TDB). However, spacecraft clock conversion
   is mentioned only in the context of background information in Appendix
   A. Mice routines dealing with spacecraft clock are discussed in SCLK
   Required Reading (<a href="../req/sclk.html"><a href="../req/sclk.html">sclk.req</a></a>).

<H3> Detection of Non-native Text Files
</H3><P><BR><BR>
   Starting with the N0057 release of the SPICE Toolkit (March, 2004) the
   SPICE data loading mechanism detects and prohibits loading text kernel
   files containing lines terminated with EOF character(s) non-native to
   the platform on which the Toolkit was compiled. If a non-native EOL
   terminator is detected in the first 132 characters of a text kernel, the
   execution is stopped and an error message is displayed. This feature
   does not work with files that are smaller that 132 bytes or have the
   first line longer that 132 characters.

   Mice contains a versatile set of time conversion routines designed to
   simplify conversions between several time systems. The basic time
   systems supported are: Coordinated Universal Time (UTC), Barycentric
   Dynamical Time (TDB) and Terrestrial Dynamical Time (TDT). In addition,
   most common time formats are supported including: calendar, day of year,
   and Julian Date.

<H3> The J2000 Epoch
</H3><P><BR><BR>
   The basic spatial reference system for Mice is the J2000 system. This is
   an inertial reference frame in which the equations of motion for the
   solar system may be integrated. This reference frame is specified by the
   orientation of the earth's mean equator and equinox at a particular
   epoch --- the J2000 epoch. This epoch is Greenwich noon on January 1,
   2000 Barycentric Dynamical Time. Throughout the Mice documentation, you
   will see the expressions: ``seconds past 2000''; ``seconds past J2000'';
   or ``seconds past the J2000 epoch.'' In all cases, the reference epoch
   is noon January 1, 2000 on a particular time scale.
<P>
 
   (As we've just seen ``J2000'' is used to name the fundamental inertial
   frame and a particular epoch. This can sometimes be confusing if you are
   not careful to distinguish the context in which the term ``J2000'' is
   used.)

   In almost all cases, before converting between different representations
   of time you must ``load'' a leapseconds kernel (LSK) into memory. The
   leapseconds kernel is a text kernel and is loaded via the routine
   <a href="../mice/cspice_furnsh.html">cspice_furnsh</a>.
<P>
 
<PRE>
    <a href="../mice/cspice_furnsh.html">cspice_furnsh</a>( '&lt;file name of leapseconds kernel&gt;' )

   The leapseconds kernel is discussed in more detail later in this

<H3> Converting Time Strings to Numeric Representations
</H3><P><BR><BR>
   If you are starting with a representation of time in the form of a
   string such as ``Mon Sep 30 09:59:10 PDT 1996'' you will normally need
   to get this into a numeric representation before you can work with it.
   The basic routine for converting strings to a numeric representation is
   <a href="../mice/cspice_str2et.html">cspice_str2et</a> (``String to ET'').
<P>
 
<PRE>
    et = <a href="../mice/cspice_str2et.html">cspice_str2et</a>( string )
</PRE>
   <a href="../mice/cspice_str2et.html">cspice_str2et</a> computes the ephemeris epoch corresponding to an input
   string. The ephemeris epoch is represented as seconds past the epoch of
   the J2000 reference frame in the time system known as Barycentric
   Dynamical Time (TDB). This time system is also referred to as Ephemeris
   Time (ET) throughout the Mice Toolkit.
<P>
 
   The variety of ways people have developed for representing times is
   enormous. It is unlikely that any single subroutine can accommodate all
   of the custom time formats that have arisen in various computing
   contexts. However, we believe that <a href="../mice/cspice_str2et.html">cspice_str2et</a> correctly interprets
   most time formats used throughout the planetary science community. For
   example <a href="../mice/cspice_str2et.html">cspice_str2et</a> supports ISO time formats, UNIX `date` output
   formats. VMS time formats, MS-DOS formats, epochs in both the A.D. and
   B.C. eras, time zones, etc.

<H3> Converting Numeric Representations to Time Strings
</H3><P><BR><BR>
   If you need to examine an epoch given as some double precision number of
   seconds past J2000, you will normally want to convert it to some more
   meaningful representation. There are two routines normally used for this
   task. They offer varying degrees of flexibility in the output strings
   they can produce. The more general of these is <a href="../mice/cspice_timout.html">cspice_timout</a>.
<P>
 
<PRE>
    [ output ] = <a href="../mice/cspice_timout.html">cspice_timout</a>( et, pictur )
</PRE>
   Given an epoch ET expressed as double precision seconds past J2000 and a
   format picture pictur that you would like to use as a model for the
   output time strings, <a href="../mice/cspice_timout.html">cspice_timout</a> produces a string representing the
   input ET in a format that matches the one specified by pictur with the
   length of the string lenout. Using <a href="../mice/cspice_timout.html">cspice_timout</a> you can produce a time
   string in almost any format you desire (including many that cannot be
   recognized by any of the Mice software). To assist in creating a format
   picture the routine <a href="../mice/cspice_tpictr.html">cspice_tpictr</a> is provided. cspice_tpictr takes a
   sample time string and produces the format picture that corresponds to
   the sample. By using <a href="../mice/cspice_tpictr.html">cspice_tpictr</a> and <a href="../mice/cspice_timout.html">cspice_timout</a> together you can
   easily produce strings in the format you are used to seeing.
<P>
 
   Less flexible, but slightly easier to use, <a href="../mice/cspice_et2utc.html">cspice_et2utc</a> has been the
   standard Mice time formatting routine for many years.
<P>
 
<PRE>
    [ utcstr ] = <a href="../mice/cspice_et2utc.html">cspice_et2utc</a>(et, format, prec)
</PRE>
   This routine supports several fixed formats: calendar, Julian Date
   (UTC), day-of-year, ISO year/month/day, and ISO year/day-of-year. You
   may adjust the number of digits that follow the decimal point in the
   seconds component (or day in the Julian Date format).

   Before any of these routines can be used you must ``load'' a leapseconds

   `kernel' is the name of a ``leapseconds kernel.'' Leapseconds kernels
   are text based kernels containing the epochs of leap seconds and other
   constants required by the time conversion routines.
<P>
 
   The leapseconds kernel needs to be loaded just once per program run;
   normally, the leapseconds kernel is loaded in a program's initialization
   section.

   The routine <a href="../mice/cspice_et2lst.html">cspice_et2lst</a> converts ephemeris time (ET) to the local
   solar time for a point at a user specified longitude on the surface of a
   body. This computation is performed using the bodyfixed location of the
   sun. Consequently, to use <a href="../mice/cspice_et2lst.html">cspice_et2lst</a> you must first load SPK and PCK
   files that contain sufficient position and orientation data for the
   computation of the bodyfixed location of the sun.

<H2> Input String Conversion
</H2><HR ALIGN="LEFT" WIDTH=50% ><P><BR><BR>
   We normally represent epochs as a combination of a date and time of day.
   The simplest means of specifying an epoch as a date and time is to
   create a string such as:
<P>
 
<PRE>
    string = 'Oct 1, 1996 09:12:32';
</PRE>
   However, arithmetic is most easily performed with numeric
   representations of time. In Mice we represent epochs as some number of
   double precision seconds past the J2000 epoch.
<P>
 
   to assign meaning to the string. Below are a number of examples of
   strings and the interpretation assigned to the various components.
<P>
 
   Mice contains one routine for converting strings directly to ``seconds
   past 2000.'' It is <a href="../mice/cspice_str2et.html">cspice_str2et</a> This routine takes a string as input
   and produces a double precision number that gives the number of seconds
   past the J2000 epoch corresponding to the input string. The method of
   analyzing the input string and assigning meaning to its various
   components is called ``parsing'' the string. Below are a number of
   examples of strings and the interpretation assigned to the various
   components.

<H3> Parsing Time Strings
</H3><P><BR><BR>
   A time string is parsed by first scanning the string from left to right
   and identifying recognizable substrings. (integers, punctuation marks,
   names of months, names of weekdays and time systems, time zones, etc.)
   These recognizable substrings are called the tokens of the input string.
   The meaning of some tokens are immediately determined. For example named
   months, weekdays and time systems have clear meanings. However, the
   meanings of numeric components must be deciphered from their magnitudes
   and location in the string relative to the immediately recognized
   components of the input string.
<P>
 
   The following substrings are immediately recognizable.
<P>
 
<UL>
<TT>1.</TT> All months (January, February, ... ) or any abbreviation of at least 3
letters;
<BR><BR></UL>
<UL>
<TT>2.</TT> All weekdays (Sunday, Monday, ... ) or any abbreviation of at least 3
letters;
<BR><BR></UL>
<UL>
<TT>3.</TT> Standard abbreviations of U.S. time zones: 'EST', 'EDT', 'CST', 'CDT',
'MST', 'MDT', 'PDT', 'PST'.
<BR><BR></UL>
<UL>
<TT>4.</TT> The abbreviations for eras: 'B.C.', 'BC', 'A.D.', and 'AD';
<BR><BR></UL>
<UL>
<TT>5.</TT> Time systems: 'TDT', 'TDB', 'UTC' (Note that 'ET' is not a recognized time
system);
<BR><BR></UL>
<UL>
<TT>6.</TT> Julian Date Label: 'JD' (Note that JED is not a recognized Julian Date
Label);
<BR><BR></UL>
<UL>
<TT>7.</TT> The 12-hour clock labels: 'A.M.', 'AM', 'P.M.' and 'PM';
<BR><BR></UL>
<UL>
<TT>8.</TT> Time Zones expressed as UTC offsets: UTC+HR:MN, UTC-HR:MN where HR is an
unsigned integer between 0 and 12 inclusive; MN is an unsigned integer
between 0 and 59 inclusive.
<BR><BR></UL>
   With the exception of months, all items above may be enclosed in
   parentheses. For example 'TDB' and '(TDB)' are both recognized as the
   same time system.
<P>
 
   The case of the letters in these substrings does not matter. For example
   all of the various ways of writing 'TDB' ( 'TDB', 'tDB', ... 'tdb') are
   recognized as 'TDB'.
<P>
 
   It is not necessary to leave space between the various substrings. For
   example JDTDT and JDUTC are recognized as 'JD' followed by 'TDT' and
   'JD' followed by 'UTC' respectively.
<P>
 
   To determine the meaning of the numeric tokens in the input string, a
   set of transformation rules are applied to the full set of tokens in the
   string. These transformations are repeated until the meaning of every
   token has been determined or until further transformations yield no new
   clues into the meaning of the numeric tokens. Here is an overview of the
   rules that are applied to the various tokens in the string.
<P>
 
<UL>
<TT>1.</TT> Unless the substring JD or jd is present the string is assumed to be a
calendar format (day-month-year or year and day of year). If the substring
JD or jd is present, the string is assumed to represent a Julian date.
<BR><BR></UL>
<UL>
<TT>2.</TT> If the Julian date specifier is not present, any integer greater than 999
is regarded as being a year specification.
<BR><BR></UL>
<UL>
<TT>3.</TT> A dash `-' can represent a minus sign only if it precedes the first digit
in the string and the string contains the Julian date specifier (JD). (No
negative years, months, days, etc are allowed).
<BR><BR></UL>
<UL>
<TT>4.</TT> Numeric components of a time string must be separated by a character that
is not a digit or decimal point. Only one decimal component is allowed. For
example 1994219.12819 is sometimes interpreted as the 219th day of 1994 +
0.12819 days. The Mice time parsing software does not support such strings.
<BR><BR></UL>
<UL>
<TT>5.</TT> No exponential components are allowed. For example you can't input 1993 Jun
23 23:00:01.202E-4. You have to explicitly list all zeros that follow the
decimal point: i.e. 1993 Jun 23 23:00:00.0001202
<BR><BR></UL>
<UL>
<TT>6.</TT> The single colon (:) when used to separate numeric components of a string
is interpreted as separating Hours, Minutes, and Seconds of time.
<BR><BR></UL>
<UL>
<TT>7.</TT> If a double slash (//) or double colon (::) follows a pair of integers,
those integers are assumed to represent the year and day of year.
<BR><BR></UL>
<UL>
<TT>8.</TT> A quote followed by an integer less than 100 is regarded as an abbreviated
year. For example: '93 would be regarded as the 93rd year of the reference
century.
<BR><BR></UL>
<UL>
<TT>9.</TT> An integer followed by 'B.C.' or 'A.D.' is regarded as a year in the era
associated with that abbreviation.
<BR><BR></UL>
<UL>
<TT>10.</TT> All dates are regarded as belonging to the extended Gregorian Calendar (the
Gregorian calendar is the calendar currently used by western society).
<BR><BR></UL>
<UL>
<TT>11.</TT> If the ISO date-time separator (T) is present in the string, only ISO
allowed token patterns are examined for a match with the current set of
tokens. If no match is found the search is abandoned and appropriate
diagnostic messages are generated.
<BR><BR></UL>
<UL>
<TT>12.</TT> If two delimiters are found in succession in the time string, the time
string is diagnosed as an erroneous string. (Delimiters are comma, white
space, dash, slash, period, day of year mark)
<BR><BR></UL>
<UL>
<TT>&#32;&#32;</TT> Note the delimiters do not have to be the same. The pair of characters
``,-'' counts as two successive delimiters.
<BR><BR></UL>
<UL>
<TT>13.</TT> White space and commas serve only to delimit tokens in the input string;
they do not affect the meaning of any of the tokens.
<BR><BR></UL>
<UL>
<TT>14.</TT> When the sizes of the integer components do not clearly specify a year but
the name of a month is present (for example 'APR') the following patterns
are assumed
<BR><BR></UL>
<PRE>
               Year Month Day
               Month Day Year
               Year Day Month
</PRE>
<UL>
<TT>15.</TT> When integer components are separated by slashes (/) as in 3/4/5. The
integers are assumed to be Month, Day, Year. Thus in our example '3/4/5' is
assumed to mean 4th of March in the year '05.
<BR><BR></UL>
<UL>
<TT>16.</TT> If a day of year marker is present (// or ::) and the size of the integer
components does not clearly specify the year (as in 45-33//) the string is
interpreted as Year Day-of-Year. Thus 45-33// is interpreted as the 33rd
day of the year '45.
<BR><BR></UL>
   Once the various tokens have been determined and a meaning attached to
   them, the routine <a href="../mice/cspice_str2et.html">cspice_str2et</a> uses the tokens to construct the double
   precision number giving the number of seconds past J2000 that

   In addition, any other time zone may be specified by representing its
   offset from UTC.
<P>
 
   To specify an offset from UTC you need to create an offset label. The
   label starts with the letters `UTC' followed by a `+' for time zones
   east of Greenwich and `-' for time zones west of Greenwich. This is
   followed by the number of hours to add or subtract from UTC. This is
   optionally followed by a colon `:' and the number of minutes to add or
   subtract to get the local time zone. Thus to specify the time zone of
   Calcutta (which is 5 and 1/2 hours ahead of UTC) you would specify the
   time zone to be UTC+5:30. To specify the time zone of Newfoundland
   (which is 3 and 1/2 hours behind UTC) use the offset notation UTC-3:30.

   All three string transformation routines treat abbreviated years in the

   The functionality of the routine TIMDEF, which is present in other

   <a href="../mice/cspice_timdef_get.html">cspice_timdef_get</a>

   These routines respectively enable the caller to set a default time
   system attribute or retrieve the current value of such an attribute.
<P>
 
   When a string is presented without a time system or time zone label
   <a href="../mice/cspice_str2et.html">cspice_str2et</a> assumes that the string represents a time in a default
   time zone or time system. If you take no action, the default time system
   is UTC. (There is no time zone offset; UTC is the same as UTC+00:00) You
   can override the default by simply including the time zone or time
   system of interest in the input time string. However, under some
   circumstances you may find that you almost always use the TDB time
   system. In such a case you would normally need to include the TDB label
   in the time string every time you use <a href="../mice/cspice_str2et.html">cspice_str2et</a>. Hence, the defaults
   used by <a href="../mice/cspice_str2et.html">cspice_str2et</a> might be a hindrance rather than a convenience.
   With this possibility in mind, <a href="../mice/cspice_str2et.html">cspice_str2et</a> has been designed so that
   you may alter its default behavior with regard to default time system or
   time zone. To change the default time system or time zone use the
   routine <a href="../mice/cspice_timdef_set.html">cspice_timdef_set</a>.
<P>
 
   (Keep in mind that if you specify a time zone or time system label in
   the input time string the default time zone or system is not used. The

<H3> Calendars
</H3><P><BR><BR>
   The default calendar used by <a href="../mice/cspice_str2et.html">cspice_str2et</a> is the Gregorian calendar.
   However, the Gregorian calendar did not come into existence until
   October 15, 1582. To complicate matters, many countries did not adopt
   the Gregorian calendar until centuries later. Prior to adoption of the
   Gregorian calendar most western societies used the Julian calendar. The
   generation of successive days is identical on the Julian and Gregorian
   calendars except for the determination of leap days in the last year of
   a century such as the year 1900. On the Julian calendar, a leap day is
   inserted as the last day of February every 4 years. on the Gregorian
   calendar, a leap day is inserted as the last day of February every 4
   years with the possible exception of the last year of a century (such as
   1900). The last year of a century is a leap year only if the year is
   evenly divisible by 400. Thus the year 2000 is a leap year on the
   Gregorian calendar but 1900 is not.
<P>
 
   Both the Gregorian and Julian calendars can be extended forward and
   backward in time indefinitely. The default behavior of <a href="../mice/cspice_str2et.html">cspice_str2et</a> is
   to use the Gregorian calendar for all epochs. However, using
   <a href="../mice/cspice_timdef_set.html">cspice_timdef_set</a> you can set the default calendar to one of three:
   GREGORIAN, JULIAN, or MIXED:
<P>

    <a href="../mice/cspice_timdef_set.html">cspice_timdef_set</a> ( 'CALENDAR', 'MIXED'     )
</PRE>
   The ``MIXED'' calendar assumes that calendar strings for epochs prior to
   October 5, 1582 belong to the Julian Calendar; strings for later epochs
   are assumed to belong to the Gregorian Calendar. The specification of a
   calendar, does not affect a previous setting of a time system or time
   zone. You can change the calendar used by <a href="../mice/cspice_str2et.html">cspice_str2et</a> only through the
   routine <a href="../mice/cspice_timdef_set.html">cspice_timdef_set</a>; there are no labels recognized by

   Times need to be printed out as well as read in. Mice contains three
   routines for accomplishing this task: <a href="../mice/cspice_timout.html">cspice_timout</a>, <a href="../mice/cspice_et2utc.html">cspice_et2utc</a>, and
   <a href="../mice/cspice_etcal.html">cspice_etcal</a>. All three convert a number of ephemeris seconds past J2000

</H3><P><BR><BR>
   The routine <a href="../mice/cspice_timout.html">cspice_timout</a> provides a mechanism for formatting output
   time strings in almost any form you desire. The calling sequence for
   <a href="../mice/cspice_timout.html">cspice_timout</a> is:
<P>
 
<PRE>
    [ output ] = <a href="../mice/cspice_timout.html">cspice_timout</a>( et, pictur )
</PRE>
   where
<P>
 
<DL><DT>
<B>
 `et'
</B><BR><BR>
<DD>
 is a double precision number containing the number of TDB seconds past
J2000 corresponding to some epoch.<BR>
</DL>
<DL><DT>
<B>
 `pictur'
</B><BR><BR>
<DD>
 is a characters string that describes how the output string should be
formatted. It is a ``picture'' of the format for output.<BR>
</DL>
<DL><DT>
<B>
 `output'
</B><BR><BR>
<DD>
 is the string corresponding to `et' and `pictur'.<BR>
</DL>
   To see how this works, consider the following example time string:
<P>
 
<PRE>
   04:29:29.292 Jan 13, 1996
</PRE>
   The value of `pictur' to use to create time strings that are similar in
   appearance to the example string is:
<P>
 
<PRE>
   pictur = 'HR:MN:SC.### Mon DD, YYYY ::RND';
</PRE>
   Most of this components in `pictur' are fairly obvious. The exception is
   the substring
<P>
 
<PRE>
   '::RND'.
</PRE>
   This substring tells <a href="../mice/cspice_timout.html">cspice_timout</a> to round the seconds portion of the
   output string instead of simply truncating. (Note that the case of the
   letters is significant in pictur.) <a href="../mice/cspice_timout.html">cspice_timout</a> can produce strings
   representing epochs in the time systems (UTC, TDB, TDT) or any time
   zone, and on either the Julian, Gregorian Calendar or Mixed Calendar.
   You may round or truncate numeric components.
<P>
 
   The rules for constructing pictur are spelled out in the header to
   <a href="../mice/cspice_timout.html">cspice_timout</a>. However, you may very well never need to learn these
   rules. Mice contains the routine <a href="../mice/cspice_tpictr.html">cspice_tpictr</a> that can construct a time
   format picture for you from a sample time string. Returning to the
   example above, if the following block of code is executed, pictur will
   contain the format picture that will yield output strings similar to our
   example string.
<P>
 
<PRE>
    exampl = '04:29:29.292 Jan 13, 1996';
 
    [pictur, ok, errmsg] = <a href="../mice/cspice_tpictr.html">cspice_tpictr</a>( exampl )
</PRE>
   The arguments ok and error are outputs from <a href="../mice/cspice_tpictr.html">cspice_tpictr</a>. They are
   present because some strings are not recognized as time strings.
   <a href="../mice/cspice_tpictr.html">cspice_tpictr</a> recognizes the same set of time strings as does
   <a href="../mice/cspice_str2et.html">cspice_str2et</a>. However, if you want your output string to be in a system
   other than UTC you must supply the label for that system in your example
   string. <a href="../mice/cspice_tpictr.html">cspice_tpictr</a> can construct format pictures for strings that are
   not accepted by the string conversion routines. For example, if you
   would like to suppress the year in a calendar output format, you could
   use the following example string:
<P>
 
<PRE>
    exampl = 'Jan 12, 02:28:29.### A.M. (PDT)';
</PRE>
   Even though this string is ambiguous as an epoch (there's no year
   specified), it is sufficient for determining a picture that describes
   its format. If you decide to use <a href="../mice/cspice_tpictr.html">cspice_tpictr</a> with inputs like this, be
   sure to check the output flag OK. Even though you know what is intended,
   <a href="../mice/cspice_tpictr.html">cspice_tpictr</a> may have problems with some ambiguous time strings.

   In addition, you may specify the number of decimal places in the
   fractional part of the seconds token or the Julian Date (three, in the
   examples above). Note that Julian Dates are prefaced with the character
   string `JD' (and are UTC Julian Dates). This allows strings generated by

   leapseconds; each day has exactly 86400 seconds. Since it does not make
   use of leapseconds, you don't need to load a leapseconds kernel prior to

<H2> Local Solar Time
</H2><HR ALIGN="LEFT" WIDTH=50% ><P><BR><BR>
   Local solar time is a used to give people an idea of how high the sun is
   in the sky as seen from a particular site on surface of a planet or
   satellite. When the Sun is on the zenith meridian, the local solar time
   is 12:00:00 noon. For points on the equator of a body, the Sun rises
   around 6:00:00 A.M. local solar time; it sets around 6:00:00 P.M. local
   solar time.
<P>
 
   Formally, the local solar time at a site on a body is the difference
   between the planetocentric longitude of the site and the planetocentric
   longitude of the Sun as seen from the center of the body. The angular
   difference in these two longitudes is measured in hours, minutes, and
   seconds in the same sense that hours, minutes and seconds are used to
   measure right ascension--- 24 hours in 360 degrees; 60 minutes in an
   hour; 60 seconds in a minute. When the sun in on the zenith meridian the
   hour is defined to be 12. Finally, the hours increase from sunrise to
   sunset.
<P>
 
   Because of these conventions, an hour of local solar time will not be of
   the same duration as a UTC hour. In the case of a site on Mars, a solar
   hour will be approximately 62 UTC minutes.
<P>
 
   Local solar time for a specific site can be computed using the routine

   Before discussing Coordinated Universal Time we feel it is helpful to
   talk about International Atomic Time (TAI or atomic time). Atomic time
   is based upon the atomic second as defined by the ``oscillation of the
   undisturbed cesium atom.'' Atomic time is simply a count of atomic
   seconds that have occurred since the astronomically determined instant
   of midnight January 1, 1958 00:00:00 at the Royal Observatory in
   Greenwich, England. Atomic time is kept by the International Earth
   Rotation Service (IERS, formally the Bureau International L'Heure---BIH)
   in Paris, France. The National Bureau of Standards and the U.S. Naval
   Observatory set their clocks by the clock maintained by the IERS.

<H3> Naming the seconds of TAI --- UTC
</H3><P><BR><BR>
   Coordinated Universal Time is a system of time keeping that gives a name
   to each instant of time of the TAI system. These names are formed from
   the calendar date and time of day that we use in our daily affairs. They
   consist of 6 components: year, month, day, hour, minutes and seconds.
   The year, month and day components are the normal calendar year month
   and day that appear on wall calendars. The hours component may assume
   any value from 0 through 23. The minutes component may assume any value
   from 0 to 59. The seconds will usually (but not always) range from 0 to
   59.999... . The hour-minute-second string
<P>
 
<PRE>
   '00:00:00'
</PRE>
   is midnight and is the first instant of the calendar day specified by
   the first three components of the UTC time.
<P>
 
   In the Mice system UTC times are represented by character strings. These
   strings contain: year, month, day, hour, minute and second separated by
   delimiters (spaces or punctuation marks). The various delimiters and
   substrings between the delimiters are called the tokens of the string. A
   typical time string looks like
<P>
 
<PRE>
       '5 OCTOBER 1986 7:20:16.122 (UTC)'
</PRE>
   The tokens of the string and the associated UTC time components are
<P>
 
<PRE>
   '5'       --- day
   'OCTOBER' --- month
   '1986'    --- year
   '7'       --- hours
   '20'      --- minutes
   '16.122'  --- seconds
</PRE>
   The link between any token and its corresponding UTC component is
   determined by examining the values of the tokens and comparing them to
   the other tokens. The precise rules used are spelled out in great detail
   in Appendix B. For now, simply be assured that the following five
   strings all mean the same thing and are interpreted in the same way by
   Mice Toolkit software.

   The names given to TAI instants by the UTC system are governed by the
   earth's rotation. Ideally, UTC strings having hours, minutes and seconds
   components all zero should correspond to Greenwich midnight as
   determined by the observations of the transits of stars (the time system
   known as UT1). However, since the rotation of the earth is not uniform,
   this ideal cannot be realized. The difference between Greenwich midnight
   observed astronomically and UTC midnight is almost never zero. However,
   to keep the difference from becoming too large, UTC is occasionally
   adjusted so that the difference between the two midnights never exceeds
   .9 seconds. Thus from a knowledge of UTC one can always compute UT1 to
   better than 1 second accuracy.

   When Greenwich UT1 midnight lags behind UTC midnight by more than 0.9

   a UTC second is added the hours-minutes-seconds portion of the UTC name
   progresses as shown here

   Should Greenwich UT1 midnight run ahead of UTC midnight by more than 0.9

<H3> The Leapseconds Kernel (LSK)
</H3><P><BR><BR>
   The primary difficulty with UTC strings is that it is not possible to
   predict which atomic times will correspond to times during a UTC leap
   second. Thus algorithms for converting between UTC and time systems that
   simply use a continuous set of numeric markers require knowledge of the
   location of leap seconds in the list of names. This is the purpose of
   the LEAPSECONDS kernel supplied with the Toolkit. To convert between UTC
   times and any other system, you must first load the leapseconds kernel
   via a call to the routine <a href="../mice/cspice_furnsh.html">cspice_furnsh</a>.
<P>
 
   LSK files conform to a flexible format called ``NAIF text kernel''
   format. The SPICE file identification word provided by itself on the
   first line of an LSK file is ``KPL/LSK''. Both the NAIF text kernel

   Ephemeris time is the uniform time scale represented by the independent

<H3> The Relationship between TDT and TDB
</H3><P><BR><BR>
   TDB is believed to be in agreement with the time that would be kept by
   an atomic clock located at the solar system barycenter. A comparison of
   the times kept by a clock at the solar system barycenter with a TDB
   clock on earth would reveal that the two clocks are in close agreement
   but that they run at different rates at different times of the year.
   This is due to relativistic effects.
<P>
 
   At some times in the year the TDT clock appears to run fast when
   compared to the TDB clock, at other times of the year it appears to run
   slow. Let TDB0 be some fixed epoch on the TDB clock and TDT0 be a fixed
   epoch on the TDT clock (TDB0 and TDT0 do not necessarily have to be the
   same epoch). Any epoch, EPOCH, can be represented in the following ways:
   as the number of seconds TDB(EPOCH), that have elapsed since TDB0 on the
   TDB clock; or as the number of seconds, TDT(EPOCH), that have elapsed
   since TDT0 on the TDT clock. If we plot the differences TDB(EPOCH) -
   TDT(EPOCH) against TDB(EPOCH) over all epochs, we will find that the
   graph is very close to a periodic function.
<P>
 
   In Mice the difference between TDT and TDB is computed as follows:
<P>
 
<PRE>
   [1]      TDB - TDT =  K * sin (E)
</PRE>
   where K is a constant, and E is the eccentric anomaly of the
   heliocentric orbit of the Earth-Moon barycenter. This difference, which
   ignores small-period fluctuations, is accurate to about 0.000030
   seconds. Thus to five decimal places the difference between TDT and TDB
   is a periodic function with magnitude approximately 0.001658 seconds and
   period equal to one sidereal year.
<P>
 
   The eccentric anomaly E is given by
<P>
 
<PRE>
   [2]     E = M + EB sin (M)
</PRE>
   where EB and M are the eccentricity and mean anomaly of the heliocentric
   orbit of the Earth-Moon barycenter. The mean anomaly is in turn given by
<P>
 
<PRE>
   [3]     M = M0 + M1*t
</PRE>
   where t is the epoch TDB expressed in barycentric dynamical seconds past
   the epoch of J2000.

   The values K, EB, M0, and M1 are retrieved from the kernel pool. These
   are part of the leapseconds kernel. They correspond to the ``kernel pool
   variables'' DELTET/K, DELTET/EB, and DELTET/M. The nominal values are:

   Ephemeris time is given in terms of seconds past a reference epoch. The

   Although ephemeris time is a formal time, within the limits of
   measurements it coincides with atomic time. As such we should be able to
   relate it to the expressions of time that we use everyday.
<P>
 
   However, ephemeris time is described as a count of ephemeris seconds
   past the ephemeris reference epoch (J2000). For most of us the
   expression
<P>
 
<PRE>
   -312819349 seconds past the ephemeris epoch J2000
</PRE>
   bears little relationship to the time system we use to organize our
   lives. For this reason, it is common to give names to the various
   ephemeris seconds in a manner analogous to the UTC naming of the seconds
   of TAI---as a calendar date and time of day. The above string
   corresponds to
<P>
 
<PRE>
   '1990 FEB 1 21:44:11 (TDB)'
</PRE>
   There is an important distinction between the names given to ephemeris
   seconds and the names used by the UTC system. The names assigned to
   ephemeris times never have leap seconds. The `seconds' component of the
   name is restricted to and includes all values from 0 to 59.999... . Thus
   the time string above does not represent the same moment in time as does
   ``1990 FEB 1 21:44:11 (UTC)'' There are two reasons. First, ephemeris
   time is ahead of atomic time by 32.184 seconds. Second, when a leap
   second occurs UTC strings fit an extra name into the sequence of valid
   UTC names. Thus it appears that UTC names fall behind ET names by a
   second after each leapsecond. At the present time UTC time strings
   appear to be 62.184 seconds behind ET time strings. This appearance is
   due to the fact that the two naming conventions are not the same. They
   simply have a lot of names in common.
<P>
 
   It is both fortunate and unfortunate that there is a huge set of common
   names between calendar dates ET and calendar dates UTC. Since there are
   relatively few leapseconds, a time given by an ET name is always close
   to the time in the UTC system having the same name. Thus for planning
   observations, you can know what day the observation will take place,
   whether or not you are likely to need a coat and how to arrange your
   daily activities around the observation. But for precise work you must
   pay attention to the difference between the two times systems. If in
   planning the observation of a stellar occultation by an asteroid the
   difference between the two naming systems is neglected, it is likely
   that the observation will be missed.
<P>

<H3> Some Consequences of Leapseconds
</H3><P><BR><BR>
   There is no way of predicting when future leapseconds will occur.
   Normally you can predict whether there will be a leapsecond in the next
   few months, but beyond this predictions of leapseconds are not reliable.
   As a result we cannot say with certainty when a particular future UTC
   epoch will occur. For example, suppose you have a timer that you can set
   to ``beep'' after some number of seconds have passed. If this timer
   counts seconds perfectly without loosing or gaining time over decades,
   you cannot set it today to beep at midnight (00:00:00) January 1 (UTC)
   ten years from now---the number of leapseconds that will occur in the
   next ten years is not known. On the other hand, it is possible to set
   the timer so that it will beep at midnight January 1 (TDB). The TDB
   system does not have leapseconds. It is only necessary to know an
   algorithm (such as <a href="../mice/cspice_str2et.html">cspice_str2et</a>) for converting calendar epochs TDB to
   seconds past some reference epoch in order to determine how to set the
   timer to beep at the correct epoch.
<P>
 
   Any given Leapseconds Kernel will eventually become obsolete. Sometime
   after the creation of any Leapseconds Kernel there will be new
   leapseconds. When future leapseconds occur the old Leapseconds Kernel
   will no longer correctly describe the relationship between UTC, TDT and
   TDB for epochs that follow the new leapsecond. However, for epochs prior
   to the new leapsecond, the old kernel will always correctly describe the
   relationship between UTC, TDT and TDB.

</PRE>
   At least in October 1996, it's clear that if you have either TDT or UTC
   you can construct the corresponding representation for the same epoch in
   the UTC or TDT system by simply subtracting or adding 62.184 seconds.
<P>
 
   If you don't worry about what happens during a leapsecond you can
   express the above idea as:
<P>
 
<PRE>
   [4]           DeltaTDT =  TDT - UTC
</PRE>
   For all epochs except during UTC leapseconds the above expression makes
   sense. DeltaTDT is simply a step function increasing by one after each
   leapsecond. Thus DeltaTDT can be viewed as a step function of either UTC
   or TDT.
<P>
 
   If you rearrange this expression, you can get
<P>
 
<PRE>
   [5]           UTC = TDT - DeltaTDT
</PRE>
   Since, TDT can be expressed as seconds past J2000 (TDT), the above
   expression indicates the UTC can be expressed as some count of seconds.
   This representation is referred to by the dubious name of ``UTC seconds
   past J2000.'' If you write down the UTC calendar time string
   corresponding to an epoch and count the number of seconds between that
   calendar expression and the UTC calendar expression ``January 1, 2000
   12:00:00'' and ignore leapseconds, you get the value of UTC in the
   expression above.
<P>
 
   In practice this expression is broken down as follows:
<P>
 
<PRE>
   [6]           UTC  =  TDT - DeltaTA - DeltaAT
</PRE>
   where
<P>
 
<PRE>
                 DeltaTA =  (TDT - TAI)
</PRE>
   and
<P>
 
<PRE>
                 DeltaAT =  DeltaTDT - DeltaTA
</PRE>
   The value DeltaTA is a constant, its value is nominally 32.184 seconds.
   DeltaTA is a step function. These two variables appear in the
   leapseconds kernel.
<P>
 
   If we combine equation [6] above with equation [1] from the section
   ``The Relationship between TDT and TDB'' we get the following expression
<P>
 
<PRE>
   [7]           TDB - UTC =  DeltaTA + DeltaAT + K*sin(E)
</PRE>
   This last value is called DeltaET and is computed by the Mice routine
   <a href="../mice/cspice_deltet.html">cspice_deltet</a>. The various values that are used in the computation of
   DeltaET are contained in the Leapseconds Kernel. Indeed, a Leapseconds
   Kernel consists of precisely the information needed to compute DeltaET.
   Below is a sample Leapseconds kernel.

   Although NAIF recommends against it, you could modify this file to alter
   the conversion. For example, until 1985 JPL's Orbit Determination
   Program (ODP) set used a value of 32.1843817 for DeltaTA, and some older
   CRS tapes were created using this value in the conversion from TAI to
   TDT. The value returned by <a href="../mice/cspice_deltet.html">cspice_deltet</a> can be made compatible with
   these tapes by replacing the current value (32.184, exactly) with the
   older value. Also, JPL'S Optical Navigation Program (ONP) set does not
   use the periodic term (K sin E) of the difference TDB-TDT. Setting the
   value of K to zero eliminates this term.

   As we pointed out above, the expression ( TDT - UTC ) is meaningful as
   long as you stay away from leapseconds. If you write down the TDT and
   UTC representations for an epoch that occurs during a leapsecond you
   will have something like this:
<P>

   1996 Dec 31, 23:59:60.5000  (UTC)
</PRE>
   Given these two epochs, it is no longer clear what we should assign to
   the value TDT - UTC. Thus although equation [7] above provides a simple
   expression for computing the ``difference between UTC and TDB'', the
   expression fails to tell us how to convert between TDB (or TDT) and UTC
   during leapseconds. For this reason the Mice system does not use DeltaET
   when converting between TDB (or TDT) and UTC. Instead, the table of
   offsets corresponding to DeltaAT in the leapseconds kernel is converted
   to an equivalent table as shown below.

   Given an epoch to be converted between UTC and some other time system

   To convert between TAI and UTC, we examine the above table to determine
   whether or not the epoch in question falls on a day containing a
   leapsecond or during a day that is 86400 seconds in length. Once the
   length of the day associated with the epoch has been determined, the
   conversion from UTC to TAI (or from TAI to UTC) is straight forward.
   Having settled the problem of converting between TAI and UTC, the

   When asking for the matrix which describes the pointing for some
   structure or instrument used to perform an observation, you will usually
   request this information by supplying the spacecraft clock string that
   was used to tag the observation. This string must usually be related to
   UTC or ET. Consequently it is necessary to load a file of ``spacecraft
   clock coefficients'' that enables Mice software to transform the
   spacecraft clock string into one of the other time systems. This file of
   spacecraft clock coefficients is loaded with the routine <a href="../mice/cspice_furnsh.html">cspice_furnsh</a>.

   The Julian date system is a numerical time system that allows you to
   easily compute the number of days between two epochs. NAIF recognizes
   two types of Julian dates. Julian Ephemeris Date (JED) and Julian Date
   UTC (JDUTC). As with calendar dates used for ephemeris time and calendar
   dates UTC, the distinction between the two systems is important. The
   names of the two systems overlap, but they correspond to different
   moments of time.
<P>
 
   Julian Ephemeris Date is computed directly from ET via the formula
<P>
 
<PRE>
   jed = <a href="../mice/cspice_j2000.html">cspice_j2000</a> + et/<a href="../mice/cspice_spd.html">cspice_spd</a>;

   where J2000 is a constant function that returns the Julian Ephemeris
   Date of the reference epoch for ET, and SPD is a constant function that
   gives the number or seconds per day.
<P>
 
   Julian Date UTC has an integer value whenever the corresponding UTC time
   is noon.
<P>
 
   We recommend against using the JDUTC system as it provides no mechanism
   for talking about events that might occur during a leapsecond. All of

   This appendix gives a detailed account of how the CSPICE function

   analyzing and assigning meaning to the components of a time string.
<P>
 
   This appendix is not for everyone. Unless you need to understand in

   The first step in processing a time string is to scan it from left to
   right identifying various substrings. If a substring is encountered that
   cannot be identified, attempts to further process the string are
   abandoned.
<P>
 
   Having identified the components in the string as integers, months,
   weekdays, time systems, etc. An internal representation of the string is
   constructed. This representation is simply a list of the identified
   substrings in the order they are encountered. Each item in the list is
   called a token.
<P>
 
   Working with the list of tokens, various rules are applied to remove
   some tokens and combine others into new tokens. The process of
   combination and removal of tokens continues until all tokens belong to a
   special set of ``meaningful'' tokens or until no further combinations
   and removals can be performed. If processing stops before all tokens are
   meaningful, a diagnostic message is created and the string is regarded
   as un-parsable. If all of the tokens are meaningful, a compatibility
   check is performed on the tokens to make sure that they unambiguously
   specify an epoch.
<P>
 
   Once it is clear that an unambiguous epoch has been specified, the
   substrings corresponding to the meaningful tokens are converted into
   numeric representations or are noted so that the time conversion
   software can properly interpret the numeric components.
<P>
 
   Almost all of the work of manipulating tokens is carried out by Mice
   private routines. These routines are not considered part of the Mice
   public interface. Feel free to read and copy these routines. However, we
   strongly recommend that you not call these routines in your own code
   since we do not guarantee backward compatibility of these routines in
   future releases of the Toolkit.

   The first step in parsing a time string is to decompose it into
   recognizable substring components. This decomposition is done as
   follows:
<P>
 
   Starting with the next unexamined character (on the first pass this is
   the first character in the string), scan from left to right looking for
   one of the following classes of substrings:

   Once the next substring has been identified, its boundaries and
   classification are stored in the next available location in the buffer
   reserved for the tokenized representation of the time string.
<P>
 
   The steps above are then repeated until the entire substring has been
   tokenized or a failure to recognize some substring occurs. If a failure
   occurs the location in the string is noted and a diagnostic message is
   created indicating the failure in the attempt to parse the string.
<P>
 
   When the tokenization is finished, there will be a list of tokens from
   which a string can be constructed that lists the class of each token.
   Each class of token is represented by a single character. By placing
   these characters in a string a simple list of token classes is
   maintained. The characters used for the remainder of this discussion are
   listed below.
<P>

   Q  stands for the quote character
   [  stands for the left parenthesis character

   Once an internal tokenized representation of the time string has been

<TT>1.</TT> A token can be ``removed'' from the representation based on its

   Having processed the token list to this point, we check to see if what
   remains is one of those in a large set of immediately recognized token
   lists. The complete list is shown below. As in the case of ISO formats,
   the left item is the token list, the right item is the transformation
   after removing delimiters. Note that the letter `d' stands for a
   day-of-year delimiter ( `//' or `::' ).

   As can be surmised from the preceding discussion, it is very difficult
   to give a complete list of all token patterns that might yield a parsed
   time string. Nevertheless, we feel that the approach taken and the
   transformations applied will yield correct and consistent
   interpretations of the many ways people choose to represent time.
