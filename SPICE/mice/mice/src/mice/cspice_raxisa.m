%-I/O
%
%   Given:
%
%      matrix   rotation matrix that gives the transformation from
%               some frame "frame1" to another frame "frame2".
%
%               [3,3]   = size(matrix); double = class(matrix)
%
%   the call:
%
%      [axis, angle] = cspice_raxisa( matrix )
%
%   returns:
%
%      axis   the unit vector pointing along the axis of the rotation. In
%             other words, 'axis' is a unit eigenvector of the input matrix,
%             corresponding to the eigenvalue 1. If the input matrix is
%             the identity matrix, 'axis' will be the vector (0, 0, 1).
%             If the input rotation is a rotation by pi radians, both
%             'axis' and -'axis' may be regarded as the axis of the rotation.
%
%             [3,1] = size(axis); double = class(axis)
%
%      angle  the angle between 'v' and 'matrix'*'v' for any non-zero vector
%             'v' orthogonal to 'axis'. 'angle' is given in radians.
%             The angle returned will be in the range from 0 to pi radians.
%
%             [1,1] = size(angle); double = class(angle)
%
%-Examples
%
%   Any numerical results shown for this example may differ between
%   platforms as the results depend on the SPICE kernels used as input
%   and the machine specific arithmetic implementation.
%
%      Example:
%      %
%      % Define an axis and an angle for rotation.
%      %
%      axis = [ 1.; 2.; 3. ];
%      angle = .1 * cspice_twopi;
%
%      %
%      % Determine the rotation matrix.
%      %
%      rot_mat = cspice_axisar( axis, angle );
%
%      %
%      % Now calculate the rotation axis and angle based on the
%      % matrix as input.
%      %
%      [ axout, angout ] = cspice_raxisa( rot_mat);
%
%      %
%      % Now input the axout and angout to cspice_axisar to
%      % compare against the original rotation matrix rot_mat.
%      %
%      rot_out = cspice_axisar( axout, angout );
%      rot_mat - rot_out
