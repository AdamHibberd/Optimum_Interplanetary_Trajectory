%-I/O
%
%   Given:
%
%      targ      the name of a target body. Optionally, you may supply the
%                integer ID code for the object as an integer string, i.e.
%                both 'MOON' and '301' are legitimate strings that indicate
%                the Moon is the target body.
%
%                The target and observer define a position vector
%                whose position component points from the observer
%                to the target.
%
%                [1,c1] = size(target), char = class(target)
%
%                   or
%
%                [1,1] = size(target); cell = class(target)
%
%      et        the ephemeris time(s), expressed as seconds past J2000
%                TDB, at which the position of the target body relative to
%                the observer is to be computed. 'et' refers to time at
%                the observer's location.
%
%                [1,n] = size(et); double = class(et)
%
%      ref       the name of the reference frame relative to which the output
%                position vector should be expressed. This may be any frame
%                supported by the SPICE system, including built-in frames
%                (documented in the Frames Required Reading) and frames
%                defined by a loaded frame kernel (FK).
%
%                When 'ref' designates a non-inertial frame, the
%                orientation of the frame is evaluated at an epoch
%                dependent on the selected aberration correction.
%
%                [1,c2] = size(ref); char = class(ref)
%
%                   or
%
%                [1,1] = size(ref); cell = class(ref)
%
%      abcorr    the aberration corrections to apply to the position of the
%                target body to account for one-way light time and stellar
%                aberration.
%
%                [1,c3] = size(abcorr); char = class(abcorr)
%
%                   or
%
%                [1,1] = size(abcorr); cell = class(abcorr)
%
%                'abcorr' may be any of the following:
%
%                   'NONE'     Apply no correction. Return the
%                              geometric position of the target
%                              body relative to the observer.
%
%                The following values of 'abcorr' apply to the
%                "reception" case in which photons depart from the
%                target's location at the light-time corrected epoch
%                et-lt and *arrive* at the observer's location at
%                'et':
%
%                   'LT'       Correct for one-way light time (also
%                              called "planetary aberration") using a
%                              Newtonian formulation. This correction
%                              yields the position of the target at the
%                              moment it emitted photons arriving at
%                              the observer at 'et'.
%
%                              The light time correction uses an
%                              iterative solution of the light time
%                              equation (see Particulars for details).
%                              The solution invoked by the "LT" option
%                              uses one iteration.
%
%                   'LT+S'     Correct for one-way light time and
%                              stellar aberration using a Newtonian
%                              formulation. This option modifies the
%                              position obtained with the "LT" option to
%                              account for the observer's velocity
%                              relative to the solar system
%                              barycenter. The result is the apparent
%                              position of the target---the position
%                              of the target as seen by the
%                              observer.
%
%                   'CN'       Converged Newtonian light time
%                              correction. In solving the light time
%                              equation, the "CN" correction iterates
%                              until the solution converges (three
%                              iterations on all supported platforms).
%
%                              The "CN" correction typically does not
%                              substantially improve accuracy because
%                              the errors made by ignoring
%                              relativistic effects may be larger than
%                              the improvement afforded by obtaining
%                              convergence of the light time solution.
%                              The "CN" correction computation also
%                              requires a significantly greater number
%                              of CPU cycles than does the
%                              one-iteration light time correction.
%
%                   'CN+S'     Converged Newtonian light time
%                              and stellar aberration corrections.
%
%
%                The following values of 'abcorr' apply to the
%                "transmission" case in which photons *depart* from
%                the observer's location at 'et' and arrive at the
%                target's location at the light-time corrected epoch
%                et+lt:
%
%                   'XLT'      "Transmission" case:  correct for
%                              one-way light time using a Newtonian
%                              formulation. This correction yields the
%                              position of the target at the moment it
%                              receives photons emitted from the
%                              observer's location at 'et'.
%
%                   'XLT+S'    "Transmission" case:  correct for
%                              one-way light time and stellar
%                              aberration using a Newtonian
%                              formulation  This option modifies the
%                              position obtained with the "XLT" option to
%                              account for the observer's velocity
%                              relative to the solar system
%                              barycenter. The position indicates the
%                              direction that photons emitted from the
%                              observer's location must be "aimed" to
%                              hit the target.
%
%                   'XCN'      "Transmission" case:  converged
%                              Newtonian light time correction.

%                              aberration corrections.
%
%
%                Neither special nor general relativistic effects are
%                accounted for in the aberration corrections applied
%                by this routine.

%   the call:
%
%      ptarg = mice_spkpos(targ, et, ref, abcorr, obs)
%
%   returns:
%
%      ptarg   the structure(s) containing the results of the calculation.
%
%              [1,n] = size(ptarg); struct = class(ptarg)
%
%              Each structure consists of the fields:
%
%                 pos    the Cartesian state vector representing the
%                        position of the target body relative
%                        to the specified observer. 'pos' is corrected for
%                        the specified aberrations, and is expressed with
%                        respect to the reference frame specified by 'ref'.
%
%                        [3,1] = size(ptarg(i).pos)
%                        double = class(ptarg(i).pos)
%
%                        The position points from the observer's location at
%                        'et' to the aberration-corrected location of the
%                        target. Note that the sense of the position vector
%                        is independent of the direction of radiation
%                        travel implied by the aberration correction.
%
%                        Units are always km.
%
%                        Non-inertial frames are treated as follows:
%                        letting LTCENT be the one-way light time between
%                        the observer and the central body associated
%                        with the frame, the orientation of the frame is
%                        evaluated at et-LTCENT, et+LTCENT, or et depending
%                        on whether the requested aberration correction is,
%                        respectively, for received radiation, transmitted
%                        radiation, or is omitted. LTCENT is computed using
%                        the method indicated by 'abcorr'.
%
%                 lt     the value(s) of the one-way light time between the
%                        observer and target in seconds. If the target position
%                        is corrected for aberrations, then 'lt' is the
%                        one-way light time between the observer and the
%                        light time corrected target location.
%
%                        [1,1] = size(ptarg(i).lt)
%                        double = class(ptarg(i).lt)
%
%      'ptarg' returns with the same vectorization measure (N) as 'et'.
%
%      Note, if needed, the user can extract the field data from vectorized
%      'ptarg' structures into separate arrays.
%
%      Extract the N 'pos' field data to a 6XN array 'position':
%
%         position = reshape( [ptarg(:).pos], 3, [] )
%
%      Extract the N 'lt' field data to a 1XN array 'lighttime':
%
%         lighttime = reshape( [ptarg(:).lt], 1, [] )

%
%   Aberration corrections
%   ======================
%
%   In space science or engineering applications one frequently
%   wishes to know where to point a remote sensing instrument, such
%   as an optical camera or radio antenna, in order to observe or
%   otherwise receive radiation from a target. This pointing problem
%   is complicated by the finite speed of light:  one needs to point
%   to where the target appears to be as opposed to where it actually
%   is at the epoch of observation. We use the adjectives
%   "geometric," "uncorrected," or "true" to refer to an actual
%   position or state of a target at a specified epoch. When a
%   geometric position or state vector is modified to reflect how it
%   appears to an observer, we describe that vector by any of the
%   terms "apparent," "corrected," "aberration corrected," or "light
%   time and stellar aberration corrected." The SPICE Toolkit can
%   correct for two phenomena affecting the apparent location of an
%   object:  one-way light time (also called "planetary aberration") and
%   stellar aberration.
%
%   One-way light time
%   ------------------
%
%   Correcting for one-way light time is done by computing, given an
%   observer and observation epoch, where a target was when the observed
%   photons departed the target's location. The vector from the
%   observer to this computed target location is called a "light time
%   corrected" vector. The light time correction depends on the motion
%   of the target relative to the solar system barycenter, but it is
%   independent of the velocity of the observer relative to the solar
%   system barycenter. Relativistic effects such as light bending and
%   gravitational delay are not accounted for in the light time
%   correction performed by this routine.
%
%   Stellar aberration
%   ------------------
%
%   The velocity of the observer also affects the apparent location
%   of a target:  photons arriving at the observer are subject to a
%   "raindrop effect" whereby their velocity relative to the observer
%   is, using a Newtonian approximation, the photons' velocity
%   relative to the solar system barycenter minus the velocity of the
%   observer relative to the solar system barycenter. This effect is
%   called "stellar aberration."  Stellar aberration is independent
%   of the velocity of the target. The stellar aberration formula
%   used by this routine does not include (the much smaller)
%   relativistic effects.
%
%   Stellar aberration corrections are applied after light time
%   corrections:  the light time corrected target position vector is
%   used as an input to the stellar aberration correction.
%
%   When light time and stellar aberration corrections are both
%   applied to a geometric position vector, the resulting position
%   vector indicates where the target "appears to be" from the
%   observer's location.
%
%   As opposed to computing the apparent position of a target, one
%   may wish to compute the pointing direction required for
%   transmission of photons to the target. This also requires correction
%   of the geometric target position for the effects of light time
%   and stellar aberration, but in this case the corrections are
%   computed for radiation traveling *from* the observer to the target.
%   We will refer to this situation as the "transmission" case.
%
%   The "transmission" light time correction yields the target's
%   location as it will be when photons emitted from the observer's
%   location at `et' arrive at the target. The transmission stellar
%   aberration correction is the inverse of the traditional stellar
%   aberration correction:  it indicates the direction in which
%   radiation should be emitted so that, using a Newtonian
%   approximation, the sum of the velocity of the radiation relative
%   to the observer and of the observer's velocity, relative to the
%   solar system barycenter, yields a velocity vector that points in
%   the direction of the light time corrected position of the target.
%
%   One may object to using the term "observer" in the transmission
%   case, in which radiation is emitted from the observer's location.
%   The terminology was retained for consistency with earlier
%   documentation.
%
%   Below, we indicate the aberration corrections to use for some
%   common applications:
%
%      1) Find the apparent direction of a target. This is
%         the most common case for a remote-sensing observation.
%
%            Use "LT+S":  apply both light time and stellar
%            aberration corrections.
%
%         Note that using light time corrections alone ("LT") is
%         generally not a good way to obtain an approximation to an
%         apparent target vector:  since light time and stellar
%         aberration corrections often partially cancel each other,
%         it may be more accurate to use no correction at all than to
%         use light time alone.
%
%
%      2) Find the corrected pointing direction to radiate a signal
%         to a target. This computation is often applicable for
%         implementing communications sessions.
%
%            Use "XLT+S":  apply both light time and stellar
%            aberration corrections for transmission.
%
%
%      3) Compute the apparent position of a target body relative
%         to a star or other distant object.
%
%            Use "LT" or "LT+S" as needed to match the correction
%            applied to the position of the distant object. For
%            example, if a star position is obtained from a catalog,
%            the position vector may not be corrected for stellar
%            aberration. In this case, to find the angular
%            separation of the star and the limb of a planet, the
%            vector from the observer to the planet should be
%            corrected for light time but not stellar aberration.
%
%
%      4) Obtain an uncorrected state vector derived directly from
%         data in an SPK file.
%
%            Use "NONE".
%
%
%      5) Use a geometric state vector as a low-accuracy estimate
%         of the apparent state for an application where execution
%         speed is critical.
%
%            Use "NONE".
%
%
%      6) While this routine cannot perform the relativistic
%         aberration corrections required to compute states
%         with the highest possible accuracy, it can supply the
%         geometric states required as inputs to these computations.
%
%            Use "NONE", then apply relativistic aberration
%            corrections (not available in the SPICE Toolkit).
%
%
%   Below, we discuss in more detail how the aberration corrections
%   applied by this routine are computed.
%
%      Geometric case
%      ==============
%
%      spkezr_c begins by computing the geometric position T(et) of the
%      target body relative to the solar system barycenter (SSB).
%      Subtracting the geometric position of the observer O(et) gives
%      the geometric position of the target body relative to the
%      observer. The one-way light time, lt, is given by
%
%                | T(et) - O(et) |
%         lt = -------------------
%                        c
%
%      The geometric relationship between the observer, target, and
%      solar system barycenter is as shown:
%
%
%         SSB ---> O(et)
%          |      /
%          |     /
%          |    /
%          |   /  T(et) - O(et)
%          V  V
%         T(et)
%
%
%      The returned state consists of the position vector
%
%         T(et) - O(et)
%
%      and a velocity obtained by taking the difference of the
%      corresponding velocities. In the geometric case, the
%      returned velocity is actually the time derivative of the
%      position.
%
%
%      Reception case
%      ==============
%
%      When any of the options "LT", "CN", "LT+S", "CN+S" is selected
%      for `abcorr', spkezr_c computes the position of the target body at
%      epoch et-lt, where `lt' is the one-way light time. Let T(t) and
%      O(t) represent the positions of the target and observer
%      relative to the solar system barycenter at time t; then `lt' is
%      the solution of the light-time equation
%
%                | T(et-lt) - O(et) |
%         lt = ------------------------                            (1)
%                         c
%
%      The ratio
%
%          | T(et) - O(et) |
%        ---------------------                                     (2)
%                  c
%
%      is used as a first approximation to `lt'; inserting (2) into the
%      right hand side of the light-time equation (1) yields the
%      "one-iteration" estimate of the one-way light time ("LT").
%      Repeating the process until the estimates of `lt' converge yields
%      the "converged Newtonian" light time estimate ("CN").
%
%      Subtracting the geometric position of the observer O(et) gives
%      the position of the target body relative to the observer:
%      T(et-lt) - O(et).
%
%         SSB ---> O(et)
%          | \     |
%          |  \    |
%          |   \   | T(et-lt) - O(et)
%          |    \  |
%          V     V V
%         T(et)  T(et-lt)
%
%      The position component of the light time corrected state
%      is the vector
%
%         T(et-lt) - O(et)
%
%      The velocity component of the light time corrected state
%      is the difference
%
%         T_vel(et-lt)*(1-d(lt)/d(et)) - O_vel(et)
%
%      where T_vel and O_vel are, respectively, the velocities of the
%      target and observer relative to the solar system barycenter at
%      the epochs et-lt and `et'.
%
%      If correction for stellar aberration is requested, the target
%      position is rotated toward the solar system
%      barycenter-relative velocity vector of the observer. The
%      rotation is computed as follows:
%
%         Let r be the light time corrected vector from the observer
%         to the object, and v be the velocity of the observer with
%         respect to the solar system barycenter. Let w be the angle
%         between them. The aberration angle phi is given by
%
%            sin(phi) = v sin(w) / c
%
%         Let h be the vector given by the cross product
%
%            h = r X v
%
%         Rotate r by phi radians about h to obtain the apparent
%         position of the object.
%
%      When stellar aberration corrections are used, the rate of change
%      of the stellar aberration correction is accounted for in the
%      computation of the output velocity.
%
%
%      Transmission case
%      ==================
%
%      When any of the options "XLT", "XCN", "XLT+S", "XCN+S" is
%      selected, spkezr_c computes the position of the target body T at
%      epoch et+lt, where `lt' is the one-way light time. `lt' is the
%      solution of the light-time equation
%
%                | T(et+lt) - O(et) |
%         lt = ------------------------                            (3)
%                          c
%
%      Subtracting the geometric position of the observer, O(et),
%      gives the position of the target body relative to the
%      observer: T(et-lt) - O(et).
%
%                 SSB --> O(et)
%                / |    *
%               /  |  *  T(et+lt) - O(et)
%              /   |*
%             /   *|
%            V  V  V
%        T(et+lt)  T(et)
%
%      The position component of the light-time corrected state
%      is the vector
%
%         T(et+lt) - O(et)
%
%      The velocity component of the light-time corrected state
%      consists of the difference
%
%         T_vel(et+lt)*(1+d(lt)/d(et)) - O_vel(et)
%
%      where T_vel and O_vel are, respectively, the velocities of the
%      target and observer relative to the solar system barycenter at
%      the epochs et+lt and `et'.
%
%      If correction for stellar aberration is requested, the target
%      position is rotated away from the solar system barycenter-
%      relative velocity vector of the observer. The rotation is
%      computed as in the reception case, but the sign of the
%      rotation angle is negated.
%
%
%   Precision of light time corrections
%   ===================================
%
%      Corrections using one iteration of the light time solution
%      ----------------------------------------------------------
%
%      When the requested aberration correction is "LT", "LT+S",
%      "XLT", or "XLT+S", only one iteration is performed in the
%      algorithm used to compute lt.
%
%      The relative error in this computation
%
%         | LT_ACTUAL - LT_COMPUTED |  /  LT_ACTUAL
%
%      is at most
%
%          (V/C)**2
%         ----------
%          1 - (V/C)
%
%      which is well approximated by (V/C)**2, where V is the
%      velocity of the target relative to an inertial frame and C is
%      the speed of light.
%
%      For nearly all objects in the solar system V is less than 60
%      km/sec. The value of C is 300000 km/sec. Thus the one
%      iteration solution for `lt' has a potential relative error of
%      not more than 4*10**-8. This is a potential light time error
%      of approximately 2*10**-5 seconds per astronomical unit of
%      distance separating the observer and target. Given the bound
%      on V cited above:
%
%         As long as the observer and target are
%         separated by less than 50 astronomical units,
%         the error in the light time returned using
%         the one-iteration light time corrections
%         is less than 1 millisecond.
%
%
%      Converged corrections
%      ---------------------
%
%      When the requested aberration correction is "CN", "CN+S",
%      "XCN", or "XCN+S", three iterations are performed in the
%      computation of `lt'. The relative error present in this
%      solution is at most
%
%          (V/C)**4
%         ----------
%          1 - (V/C)
%
%      which is well approximated by (V/C)**4. Mathematically the
%      precision of this computation is better than a nanosecond for
%      any pair of objects in the solar system.
%
%      However, to model the actual light time between target and
%      observer one must take into account effects due to general
%      relativity. These may be as high as a few hundredths of a
%      millisecond for some objects.
%
%      When one considers the extra time required to compute the
%      converged Newtonian light time (the state of the target relative
%      to the solar system barycenter is looked up three times instead
%      of once) together with the real gain in accuracy, it seems
%      unlikely that you will want to request either the "CN" or "CN+S"
%      light time corrections. However, these corrections can be useful
%      for testing situations where high precision (as opposed to
%      accuracy) is required.
%
%
%   Relativistic Corrections
%   =========================
%
%   This routine does not attempt to perform either general or
%   special relativistic corrections in computing the various
%   aberration corrections. For many applications relativistic
%   corrections are not worth the expense of added computation
%   cycles. If however, your application requires these additional
%   corrections we suggest you consult the astronomical almanac (page
%   B36) for a discussion of how to carry out these corrections.
