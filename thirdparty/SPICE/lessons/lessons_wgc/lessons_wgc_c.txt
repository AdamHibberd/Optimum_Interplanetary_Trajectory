 
Brief Guide to Doing SPICE Hands-On Lessons Using WGC
===========================================================================
 
   November 02, 2017
 
 
Overview
--------------------------------------------------------
 
   This guide provides brief instructions on how to do SPICE ``Remote
   Sensing'' (CASSINI and ExoMars 2016), ``In-situ Sensing'', ``Geometric
   Event Finding'' (Mars Express and ExoMars 2016), and ``Binary PCK''
   hands-on lessons using the SPICE WebGeocalc (WGC) tool.
 
   Instructions for each lesson are provided in a separate section below.
   They follow the lesson steps and individual assignments within each
   step, indicate which WGC computation panels (``calculations'') should be
   used and what inputs should be entered or selected in these
   calculations, and what key outputs should be expected from WGC. Where
   applicable, they indicate that a particular quantity computed in the
   lesson cannot be computed by WGC.

      Input time                2004 JUN 11 19:32:00
      State representation      Rectangular
 
   WGC will return the following state vector, km and km/s:
 
      -1982.63976162
      -934.53047112

      3.97083213
      -3.81249566
      -2.37166299
 
   WGC does not have a separate calculation to compute angles between
   directions to objects and instrument boresights or axes of a reference
   frame, making such computations not possible in general. But for cases
   when the axis is ``Z'' such computations can be done using the ``State
   Vector'' calculation with the ``Spherical Coordinates'' output, in which
   the colatitude is equal to the desired angle.
 
   To compute the angular separation between the apparent position of Earth
   and the CASSINI high gain antenna (HGA) boresight, specify/select the
   following inputs in the ``State Vector'' calculation:
 
      Target                    EARTH
      Observer                  CASSINI
      Reference frame           CASSINI_HGA
      Light propagation         To observer
      Light-time algorithm      Newtonian

   WGC will return the following output colatitude, deg:
 
      71.92414848

      Observer                  CASSINI
      Reference frame           CASSINI_HGA
      Light propagation         To observer
      Light-time algorithm      Newtonian
      Stellar aberration        Corrected for stellar aberration
      Time system               UTC
      Time format               Calendar date and time
      Input time                2018 JUN 11 19:32:00
      State representation      Spherical
 
   WGC will return the following output colatitude, deg:
 
      73.12975130
 
   This angle is less than 90 degrees so the HGA is illuminated.

      Reference frame           IAU_PHOEBE
      Observer                  CASSINI
      Sub-point type            Near point on ellipsoid

   following distance, km:

      Input time                2004 JUN 11 19:32:00

   WGC will return the following latitude and longitude, deg, and radius,
   km:
 
      3.70986500
      23.42331102

   WGC does not allow computing planetodetic and planetographic coordinates
   on bodies that are tri-axial ellipsoids with different equatorial radii.
   Choosing the planetographic coordinates for output will result in the
   following error message:
 
      Reference frame center is not a spheroid. Planetodetic and
      planetographic coordinate representations can only be
      calculated for bodies with equal equatorial axes. The center
      body of the reference frame, PHOEBE, has equatorial axes
      that differ, 115.0 and 110.0. Use planetocentric coordinates
      instead.

   WGC will return the following state vector, km and km/s:
 
      -2843.46412456

      0.31144328
      -1.15192925
      3.08212262
 
   WGC does not have a separate calculation to compute angles between
   directions to objects and instrument boresights or axes of a reference
   frame, making such computations not possible in general. But for cases
   when the axis is ``Z'' such computations can be done using the ``State
   Vector'' calculation with the ``Spherical Coordinates'' output, in which
   the colatitude is equal to the desired angle. Since the nominal
   instrument view direction is the ``-Y'' axis of the ``TGO_SPACECRAFT''
   frame we cannot use this approach with this frame but we can use it with
   the ``TGO_NOMAD_LNO_NAD'' frame which has its ``Z'' axis along the view
   direction.
 
   To compute the angular separation between the apparent position of Mars
   and the TGO nominal instrument view direction, specify/select the
   following inputs in the ``State Vector'' calculation:

   This angle is greater than 90 degrees so the science deck is not
   illuminated.

   WGC does not allow computing planetodetic and planetographic coordinates
   on bodies that are tri-axial ellipsoids with different equatorial radii.
   Choosing the planetographic coordinates for output will result in the
   following error message:
 
      Reference frame center is not a spheroid. Planetodetic and
      planetographic coordinate representations can only be
      calculated for bodies with equal equatorial axes. The center
      body of the reference frame, PHOBOS, has equatorial axes
      that differ, 13.0 and 11.4. Use planetocentric coordinates
      instead.

``In-situ Sensing'' Hands-On Lesson Using WGC
--------------------------------------------------------
 
 
Kernels Used
 
   Use the ``SPICE Class - In-situ Sensing Lesson Kernels'' kernel set
   appearing near the bottom of the ``Kernel selection:'' menu to do all
   steps in this lesson.

      Output time system        TDB
      Output time format        Seconds past J2000
 
   WGC will return the following ET seconds past J2000:
 
      140254384.184620

   steps in order for WGC to compute values matching the results provided
   in the programming lesson. The output ET seconds may be saved for future
   use in the WGC ``Saved Values'' area by simply clicking on them with the
   left mouse button. The saved value can then be drag-n-dropped from the
   ``Saved Values'' area into the empty ``Time:'' box in the next
   calculation.

      1188593024.20844320
      501745827.05297270
 
 
Step-5: ``Sub-Spacecraft Point''
 
   To compute the planetocentric longitude and latitude of the CASSINI
   sub-spacecraft point on Phoebe, specify/select the following inputs in
   the ``Sub-Observer Point'' calculation:

      Position representation   Planetocentric
 
   WGC will return the following longitude and latitude, deg:
 
      23.42315899
      3.70979740
 
   WGC cannot compute the direction from the CASSINI spacecraft to the
   sub-spacecraft point in the INMS frame.
 
 
Step-6: ``Spacecraft Velocity''
 
   WGC cannot calculate the CASSINI spacecraft velocity with respect to
   Phoebe in the INMS frame as described in this step of the programming
   lesson.

``ExoMars-16 TGO Geometric Event Finding'' Hands-On Lesson Using WGC
--------------------------------------------------------
 
 
Kernels Used
 
   Use the ``SPICE Class - ExoMars 2016 Geometric Event Finding Lesson
   Kernels'' kernel set appearing near the bottom of the ``Kernel
   selection:'' menu to do all steps in this lesson.
 
 
Find View Periods
 
   To find the set of time intervals when the ExoMars-16 TGO (TGO) is
   visible from the ESA station NEW_NORCIA, specify/select the following
   inputs in the ``Position Event Finder'' calculation:
 
      Target                      EXOMARS 2016 TGO
      Observer                    NEW_NORCIA

   area using the ``Save All Intervals'' button to make them available for
   use as input to the next step of the lesson.
 
 
Find Times when Target is Visible
 
   To find the set of time intervals when the ExoMars-16 TGO Orbiter (TGO)
   spacecraft is visible from the ESA station NEW_NORCIA and and is not
   occulted by Mars, specify/select the following inputs in the
   ``Occultation Event Finder'' calculation:
 
      Calculation type            Occultation Event Finder
      Occultation type            Any
      Front body                  MARS
      Front body shape            Ellipsoid

      Output time unit            hours
      Complement result window    yes
      Result interval adjustment  No adjustment
      Result interval filtering   No filtering
 
   To use the time intervals found by the previous step as the input to
   this calculation, select ``List of Intervals'' in the ``Input times:''
   selector and drag and drop saved intervals from the ``Saved Values''
   area into the empty ``List of intervals:'' box.
 
   WGC will return the following interval start and stop times:
