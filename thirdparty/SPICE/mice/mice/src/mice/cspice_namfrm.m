%
%-I/O
%
%   Given:
%
%      frname   the name of some reference frame (either inertial or
%               non-inertial).
%
%               [n,m] = size(frname); char = class(frname)
%
%                  or
%
%               [1,n] = size(frname); cell = class(frname)
%
%               Leading blanks in 'frname' are ignored as is character case.
%
%               Note that all legitimate frame names contain 32 or fewer
%               characters.
%
%   the call:
%
%      frcode = cspice_namfrm(frname)
%
%   returns:
%
%      frcode   the SPICE code(s) used for internal representation of the named
%               reference frame.
%
%               [1,n] = size(frcode); int32 = class(frcode)
%
%               If the name input through frname is not recognized, 'frcode'
%               will be returned with a value of zero.
%
%              'frcode' returns with the same vectorization measure (N)
%               as 'frname'.
%
%-Examples
%
%   Any numerical results shown for this example may differ between
%   platforms as the results depend on the SPICE kernels used as input
%   and the machine specific arithmetic implementation.
%
%      %
%      % Retrieve frame information for a single frame.
%      %
%      disp('Scalar' )
%      name = 'ITRF93';
%
%      %
%      % Output the frame name corresponding to 'name'.
%      %
%      frcode = cspice_namfrm( name )
%
%
%      %
%      % Retrieve frame information for a vector of names.
%      % Create a vector of frame IDs, 1 to 5.
%      %
%      disp('Vector' )
%      codes = [1:5];
%
%      %
%      % Convert 'codes' to the corresponding frame name.
%      % 
%      names = cspice_frmnam( codes );
%
%      %
%      % Output the frame IDs corresponding to 'names'.
%      % The result should match the 'codes' vector'.
%      %
%      frcode = cspice_namfrm( names )
%
%  MATLAB outputs:
%
%      Scalar
%
%      frcode =
%
%             13000
%
%      Vector
%
%      frcode =
%
%                 1           2           3           4           5
