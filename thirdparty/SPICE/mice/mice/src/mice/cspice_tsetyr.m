%-I/O
%
%   Given:
%
%      year   the year associated with the lower bound on all year 
%             expansions.
%
%             [1,1] = size(year); int32 = class(year)
%
%   the call:
%
%      cspice_tsetyr( year )
%
%   returns:
%
%      None.
%
%-Examples
%
%   Any numerical results shown for this example may differ between
%   platforms as the results depend on the SPICE kernels used as input
%   and the machine specific arithmetic implementation.
%
%   Set the lower bound for two digit century representation to 1980.
%
%      cspice_tsetyr(1980)
%
%   This cause the SPICE time system to interpret two digit year
%   values in the following manner:
%
%      year value      implied value
%      ----------      -----------
%      00              2000
%      01              2001
%       .                .
%       .                .
%      79              2079  <- lower bound + 99 years
%      80              1980  <- lower bound
%       .                .
%       .                .
%       .                .
%      99              1999
