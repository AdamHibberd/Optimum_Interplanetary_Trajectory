   targ1      is the name of the first target body. Both object
              names and NAIF IDs are accepted. For example, both
              &quot;Moon&quot; and &quot;301&quot; are accepted.
   
   shape1     is a string indicating the geometric model used to
              represent the shape of the first target body. The
              supported options are:
   
                 &quot;ELLIPSOID&quot;     

                    Use a triaxial ellipsoid model with radius values
                    provided via the kernel pool. A kernel variable
                    having a name of the form
   
                       &quot;BODYnnn_RADII&quot;
   
                    where nnn represents the NAIF integer code
                    associated with the body, must be present in the
                    kernel pool. This variable must be associated with
                    three numeric values giving the lengths of the
                    ellipsoid's X, Y, and Z semi-axes.
   
                 &quot;POINT&quot;     

                    Treat the body as a single point. When a point
                    target is specified, the occultation conditions
                    can only be total, annular, or none.   
              
                 &quot;DSK/UNPRIORITIZED[/SURFACES = &lt;surface list&gt;]&quot;

                     Use topographic data provided by DSK files to
                     model the body's shape. These data must be
                     provided by loaded DSK files.

                     The surface list specification is optional. The
                     syntax of the list is

                        &lt;surface 1&gt; [, &lt;surface 2&gt;...]

                     If present, it indicates that data only for the
                     listed surfaces are to be used; however, data
                     need not be available for all surfaces in the
                     list. If absent, loaded DSK data for any surface
                     associated with the target body are used.

                     The surface list may contain surface names or
                     surface ID codes. Names containing blanks must
                     be delimited by double quotes, for example

                        SURFACES = &quot;Mars MEGDR 128 PIXEL/DEG&quot;

                     If multiple surfaces are specified, their names
                     or IDs must be separated by commas.

                     See the Particulars section below for details
                     concerning use of DSK data.

              The combinations of the shapes of the target bodies
              `targ1' and `targ2' must be one of:

                 One ELLIPSOID, one POINT
                 Two ELLIPSOIDs
                 One DSK, one POINT 

              Case and leading or trailing blanks are not 
              significant in the string `shape1'. 
    

   frame1     is the name of the body-fixed, body-centered reference
              frame associated with the first target body. Examples
              of such names are &quot;IAU_SATURN&quot; (for Saturn) and
              &quot;ITRF93&quot; (for the Earth).
   
              If the first target body is modeled as a point, `frame1'
              should be left blank (Ex: &quot; &quot;).
   
              Case and leading or trailing blanks bracketing a
              non-blank frame name are not significant in the string.
   

   targ2      is the name of the second target body. See the description
              of `targ1' above for more details.
   

   shape2     is the shape specification for the body designated
              by `targ2'. See the description of `shape1' above for
              details.

   
   frame2     is the name of the body-fixed, body-centered reference
              frame associated with the second target body. See the
              description of `frame1' above for more details.
   

   abcorr     indicates the aberration corrections to be applied to
              the state of each target body to account for one-way
              light time. Stellar aberration corrections are
              ignored if specified, since these corrections don't
              improve the accuracy of the occultation determination.
   
              See the header of the SPICE routine <a href="spkezr_c.html">spkezr_c</a> for a
              detailed description of the aberration correction
              options. For convenience, the options supported by
              this routine are listed below:
   
                 &quot;NONE&quot;     Apply no correction.
   
                 &quot;LT&quot;       &quot;Reception&quot; case: correct for
                            one-way light time using a Newtonian
                            formulation.
   
                 &quot;CN&quot;       &quot;Reception&quot; case: converged
                            Newtonian light time correction.
   
                 &quot;XLT&quot;      &quot;Transmission&quot; case: correct for
                            one-way light time using a Newtonian
                            formulation.
   
                 &quot;XCN&quot;      &quot;Transmission&quot; case: converged
                            Newtonian light time correction.
   
              Case and blanks are not significant in the string
              `abcorr'.
   

   obsrvr     is the name of the body from which the occultation
              is observed. See the description of `targ1' above for 
              more details.
   

   et         is the observation time in seconds past the J2000
              epoch.

   ocltid     is an integer occultation code indicating the geometric
              relationship of the three bodies.
      
                 The meaning of the sign of `ocltid' is given below.

              Possible `ocltid' values and meanings are given below.
              The variable names indicate the type of occultation and
              which target is in the back. For example,
              SPICE_OCCULT_TOTAL1 represents a total occultation in
              which the first target is in the back (or occulted by)
              the second target.

   Appropriate SPICE kernels must be loaded by the calling program
   before this routine is called.

   The following data are required:

      - SPK data: the calling application must load ephemeris data
        for the targets, source and observer that cover the time
        period specified by the window `cnfine'. If aberration
        corrections are used, the states of the target bodies and of
        the observer relative to the solar system barycenter must be
        calculable from the available ephemeris data. Typically
        ephemeris data are made available by loading one or more SPK
        files via <a href="furnsh_c.html">furnsh_c</a>.

      - PCK data: bodies modeled as triaxial ellipsoids must have
        semi-axis lengths provided by variables in the kernel pool.
        Typically these data are made available by loading a text
        PCK file via <a href="furnsh_c.html">furnsh_c</a>.

      - FK data: if either of the reference frames designated by
        `frame1' or `frame2' are not built in to the SPICE system,
        one or more FKs specifying these frames must be loaded.

   The following data may be required:

      - DSK data: if either `shape1' or `shape2' indicates that DSK
        data are to be used, DSK files containing topographic data
        for the target body must be loaded. If a surface list is
        specified, data for at least one of the listed surfaces must
        be loaded.

      - Surface name-ID associations: if surface names are specified
        in `shape1' or `shape2', the association of these names with
        their corresponding surface ID codes must be established by
        assignments of the kernel variables

           NAIF_SURFACE_NAME
           NAIF_SURFACE_CODE
           NAIF_SURFACE_BODY

        Normally these associations are made by loading a text
        kernel containing the necessary assignments. An example
        of such a set of assignments is

           NAIF_SURFACE_NAME += 'Mars MEGDR 128 PIXEL/DEG'
           NAIF_SURFACE_CODE += 1
           NAIF_SURFACE_BODY += 499

      - CK data: either of the body-fixed frames to which `frame2' or
        `frame1' refer might be a CK frame. If so, at least one CK
        file will be needed to permit transformation of vectors
        between that frame and the J2000 frame.

      - SCLK data: if a CK file is needed, an associated SCLK
        kernel is required to enable conversion between encoded SCLK
        (used to time-tag CK data) and barycentric dynamical time
        (TDB).

   Kernel data are normally loaded once per program run, NOT every
   time this routine is called.

   For many purposes, modeling extended bodies as triaxial
   ellipsoids is adequate for determining whether one body is
   occulted by another as seen from a specified observer.

   Using DSK data 
   ============== 
 
      DSK loading and unloading 
      ------------------------- 
 
      DSK files providing data used by this routine are loaded by 
      calling <a href="furnsh_c.html">furnsh_c</a> and can be unloaded by calling <a href="unload_c.html">unload_c</a> or 
      <a href="kclear_c.html">kclear_c</a>. See the documentation of <a href="furnsh_c.html">furnsh_c</a> for limits on numbers 
      of loaded DSK files. 
 
      For run-time efficiency, it's desirable to avoid frequent 
      loading and unloading of DSK files. When there is a reason to 
      use multiple versions of data for a given target body---for 
      example, if topographic data at varying resolutions are to be 
      used---the surface list can be used to select DSK data to be 
      used for a given computation. It is not necessary to unload 
      the data that are not to be used. This recommendation presumes 
      that DSKs containing different versions of surface data for a 
      given body have different surface ID codes. 
 
 
      DSK data priority 
      ----------------- 
 
      A DSK coverage overlap occurs when two segments in loaded DSK 
      files cover part or all of the same domain---for example, a 
      given longitude-latitude rectangle---and when the time 
      intervals of the segments overlap as well. 
 
      When DSK data selection is prioritized, in case of a coverage 
      overlap, if the two competing segments are in different DSK 
      files, the segment in the DSK file loaded last takes 
      precedence. If the two segments are in the same file, the 
      segment located closer to the end of the file takes 
      precedence. 
 
      When DSK data selection is unprioritized, data from competing 
      segments are combined. For example, if two competing segments 
      both represent a surface as a set of triangular plates, the 
      union of those sets of plates is considered to represent the 
      surface.  
 
      Currently only unprioritized data selection is supported. 
      Because prioritized data selection may be the default behavior 
      in a later version of the routine, the UNPRIORITIZED keyword is 
      required in the `shape1' and `shape2' arguments. 
 
       
      Syntax of the shape input arguments for the DSK case
      ----------------------------------------------------
 
      The keywords and surface list in the target shape arguments
      `shape1' and `shape2' are called &quot;clauses.&quot; The clauses may
      appear in any order, for example
 
         &quot;DSK/&lt;surface list&gt;/UNPRIORITIZED&quot;
         &quot;DSK/UNPRIORITIZED/&lt;surface list&gt;&quot;
         &quot;UNPRIORITIZED/&lt;surface list&gt;/DSK&quot;
 
      The simplest form of the `method' argument specifying use of 
      DSK data is one that lacks a surface list, for example: 
 
         &quot;DSK/UNPRIORITIZED&quot; 
 
      For applications in which all loaded DSK data for the target 
      body are for a single surface, and there are no competing 
      segments, the above string suffices. This is expected to be 
      the usual case. 
 
      When, for the specified target body, there are loaded DSK 
      files providing data for multiple surfaces for that body, the 
      surfaces to be used by this routine for a given call must be 
      specified in a surface list, unless data from all of the 
      surfaces are to be used together. 
 
      The surface list consists of the string 
 
         &quot;SURFACES = &quot;
 
      followed by a comma-separated list of one or more surface 
      identifiers. The identifiers may be names or integer codes in 
      string format. For example, suppose we have the surface 
      names and corresponding ID codes shown below: 
 
         Surface Name                              ID code 
         ------------                              ------- 
         &quot;Mars MEGDR 128 PIXEL/DEG&quot;                1 
         &quot;Mars MEGDR 64 PIXEL/DEG&quot;                 2 
         &quot;Mars_MRO_HIRISE&quot;                         3 
 
      If data for all of the above surfaces are loaded, then 
      data for surface 1 can be specified by either 
 
         &quot;SURFACES = 1&quot; 
 
      or 
 
         &quot;SURFACES = \&quot;Mars MEGDR 128 PIXEL/DEG\&quot;&quot; 
 
      Escaped double quotes are used to delimit the surface name because 
      it contains blank characters.  
          
      To use data for surfaces 2 and 3 together, any 
      of the following surface lists could be used: 
 
         &quot;SURFACES = 2, 3&quot; 
 
         &quot;SURFACES = \&quot;Mars MEGDR  64 PIXEL/DEG\&quot;, 3&quot; 
 
         &quot;SURFACES = 2, Mars_MRO_HIRISE&quot; 
 
         &quot;SURFACES = \&quot;Mars MEGDR 64 PIXEL/DEG\&quot;, Mars_MRO_HIRISE&quot; 
        
      An example of a shape argument that could be constructed 
      using one of the surface lists above is 
 
         &quot;DSK/UNPRIORITIZED/SURFACES = \&quot;Mars MEGDR 64 PIXEL/DEG\&quot;, 3&quot;
