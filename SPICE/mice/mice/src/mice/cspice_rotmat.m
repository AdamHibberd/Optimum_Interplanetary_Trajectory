%-Abstract
%
%   CSPICE_ROTMAT calculates the rotation matrix generated by
%   a rotation of a specified angle about a specified axis applied
%   to a matrix. This rotation is thought of as rotating the
%   coordinate system.

%
%-I/O
%
%   Given:
%
%      m1      the matrix to apply the rotation. In matrix algebra, the
%              components of the matrix are relative to one particular
%              coordinate system. Applying cspice_rotmat changes the
%              components of 'm1' so that they are relative to a rotated
%              coordinate system.
%
%              [3,3]   = size(m1); double = class(m1)
%
%      angle   the angle in radians through which to rotate the original
%              coordinate system.
%
%              [1,1]   = size(angle); double = class(angle)
%
%      iaxis   the index for the axis of the original coordinate system
%              about which to perform the rotation by 'angle'.
%              'iaxis' = 1,2 or 3 respectively designates the x-, y-,
%              or z-axis.
%
%              [1,1]   = size(iaxis); int32 = class(iaxis)
%
%   the call:
%
%      mout = cspice_rotmat( m1, angle, iaxis)
%
%   returns:
%
%      mout    matrix resulting from the application of 'angle' to the
%              input matrix 'm1'.
%
%              [3,3]   = size(mout); double = class(mout)
%
%              If
%
%                 [angle]
%                       iaxis
%
%              denotes the rotation matrix by 'angle' radians about 'iaxis',
%              (see the Rotations Required Reading document) then 'mout' is
%              given by the following matrix equation:
%
%                 mout = [angle]      * m1
%                               iaxis
%
%-Examples
%
%   Any numerical results shown for this example may differ between
%   platforms as the results depend on the SPICE kernels used as input
%   and the machine specific arithmetic implementation.
%
%      %
%      % Rotate the 3x3 identity matrix by 90 degrees about
%      % the y axis.
%      %
%
%      %
%      % Create the 3x3 identity matrix.
%      %
%      ident = eye(3);
%
%      %
%      % Rotate 'ident' by Pi/2 about the Y axis.
%      %
%      r = cspice_rotmat( ident, cspice_halfpi, 2 )
%
%   MATLAB outputs:
%
%      r =
%
%          0.0000         0   -1.0000
%               0    1.0000         0
%          1.0000         0    0.0000
