%-I/O
%
%   Given:
%
%      method   the name for the computation method to use.
%
%               [1,c1] = size(method); char = class(method)
%
%                  or
%
%               [1,1] = size(method); cell = class(method)
%
%               The choices are:
%
%                  'Near point'    The sub-solar point is defined
%                                  as the nearest point on the
%                                  target to the sun.
%
%                  'Intercept'     The sub-observer point is defined
%                                  as the target surface intercept of
%                                  the line containing the target's
%                                  center and the sun's center.
%
%               In both cases, the intercept computation treats the
%               surface of the target body as a triaxial ellipsoid.
%               The ellipsoid's radii must be available in the kernel
%               pool.
%
%               Neither case nor white space are significant in
%               method.  For example, the string ' NEARPOINT' is
%               valid.
%
%      target   the name of the target body. 'target' is case-insensitive,
%               and leading and trailing blanks in 'target' are not
%               significant. Optionally, you may supply a string containing
%               the integer ID code for the object. For example both 'MOON'
%               and '301' are legitimate strings that indicate the moon is
%               the target body.
%
%               [1,c2] = size(target); char = class(target)
%
%                  or
%
%               [1,1] = size(target); cell = class(target)
%
%               This routine assumes that the target body is modeled by
%               a tri-axial ellipsoid, and that a PCK file containing
%               its radii has been loaded into the kernel pool via
%               cspice_furnsh.
%
%      et       the value(s) for ephemeris time expressed as ephemeris seconds
%               past J2000 at which the sub-solar point on the target body
%               is to be computed.
%
%               [1,n] = size(et); double = class(et)
%
%      abcorr   the aberration corrections to apply when computing the
%               observer-target state.
%
%               [1,c3] = size(abcorr); char = class(abcorr)
%
%                  or
%
%               [1,1] = size(abcorr); cell = class(abcorr)
%
%               'abcorr' may be any of the following.
%
%                  'NONE'   Apply no correction. Return the
%                           geometric sub-solar point on the target
%                           body.
%
%                  'LT'     Correct for planetary (light time)
%                           aberration.  Both the state and rotation
%                           of the target body are corrected for one
%                           way light time from target to observer.
%
%                           The state of the sun relative to the
%                           target is corrected for one way light
%                           from the sun to the target; this state
%                           is evaluated at the epoch obtained by
%                           retarding et by the one way light time
%                           from target to observer.
%
%                  'LT+S'   Correct for planetary (light time) and
%                           stellar aberrations.  Light time
%                           corrections are the same as in the 'LT'
%                           case above.  The target state is
%                           additionally corrected for stellar
%                           aberration as seen by the observer, and
%                           the sun state is corrected for stellar
%                           aberration as seen from the target.
%
%                  'CN'     Converged Newtonian light time correction.
%                           This option produces a solution that is at
%                           least as accurate at that obtainable
%                           with the 'LT' option. Whether the 'CN'
%                           solution is substantially more accurate
%                           depends on the geometry of the
%                           participating objects and on the
%                           accuracy of the input data. In all
%                           cases this routine will execute more
%                           slowly when a converged solution is
%                           computed. See the section titled "The
%                           Computation of Light Time" in the SPK
%                           Required Reading document spk.req for
%                           details.
%
%                  'CN+S'   Converged Newtonian light time
%                           and stellar aberration corrections.
%                           Light time and stellar aberration
%                           corrections are applied as in the
%                           'LT+S' case.
%
%      obsrvr   the name of the observing body. This is typically a
%               spacecraft, the earth, or a surface point on the earth.
%
%               [1,c4] = size(obsrvr); char = class(obsrvr)
%
%                  or
%
%               [1,1] = size(obsrvr); cell = class(obsrvr)
%
%               `obsrvr' is case-insensitive, and leading and
%               trailing blanks in `obsrvr' are not significant.
%               Optionally, you may supply a string containing the
%               integer ID code for the object.  For example both
%               'EARTH' and '399' are legitimate strings that indicate
%               the earth is the observer.
%
%   the call:
%
%      spoint = cspice_subsol( method, target, et, abcorr, obsrvr )
%
%   returns:
%
%      spoint   the array(s) describing the sub-solar point on the target
%               body at 'et', expressed relative to the body-fixed frame
%               of the target body.
%
%               [3,n] = size(rectan); double = class(rectan)
%
%               'spoint' returns with the same vectorization measure, N,
%               as 'et'.
%
%-Examples
%
%   Any numerical results shown for this example may differ between
%   platforms as the results depend on the SPICE kernels used as input
%   and the machine specific arithmetic implementation.
%
%      %
%      % Find the sub solar position on the earth as seen from the moon at
%      % at epoch JAN 1, 2006 using the 'near point' then the 'intercept'
%      % options. Apply light time correction to return apparent position.
%      %
%      % Load the meta kernel listing the needed SPK, PCK, LSK
%      % kernels.
%      %
%      cspice_furnsh( 'standard.tm' )
%
%      et = cspice_str2et( 'JAN 1, 2006' );
%
%      %
%      % First use option 'Near Point'
%      %
%      point1 = cspice_subsol( 'near point', 'earth', et, 'lt+s', 'moon');
%
%      disp( 'Sub solar location coordinates - near point:' )
%      fprintf( '    %15.8f\n', point1 )
%
%      disp(' ')
%
%      %
%      % Now use option 'Intercept'
%      %
%      point2 = cspice_subsol( 'intercept', 'earth', et, 'lt+s', 'moon');
%
%      disp( 'Sub solar location coordinates - intercept' )
%      fprintf( '    %15.8f\n', point2 )
%
%      %
%      % Calculate the Euclidean distance between the two locations
%      % and the angular separation between the position vectors.
%      %
%      dist = norm( point1 - point2);
%      sep  = cspice_vsep(point1, point2 )*cspice_dpr;
%
%      disp(' ')
%
%      fprintf( 'Distance between locations            (km): %8.5f\n', dist);
%      fprintf( 'Angular separation between locations (deg): %8.5f\n', sep );
%
%      %
%      % It's always good form to unload kernels after use,
%      % particularly in MATLAB due to data persistence.
%      %
%      cspice_kclear
%
%   MATLAB outputs:
%
%     Sub solar location coordinates - near point:
%          -5872.12723742
%            -91.14115623
%          -2479.72440750
%
%     Sub solar location coordinates - intercept

%
%     Distance between locations            (km): 15.38338
%     Angular separation between locations (deg):  0.13826
%
%-Particulars
%
%   cspice_subsol computes the sub-solar point on a target body, as seen by
%   a specified observer.
%
%   There are two different popular ways to define the sub-solar point:
%   "nearest point on target to the sun" or "target surface intercept of
%   line containing target and sun."  These coincide when the target is
%   spherical and generally are distinct otherwise.
%
%   When comparing sub-point computations with results from sources
%   other than SPICE, it's essential to make sure the same geometric
%   definitions are used.
