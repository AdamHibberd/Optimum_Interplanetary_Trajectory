%
%-I/O
%
%   Given:
%
%      handle   the file handle for an open CK file.
%
%               [1,1] = size(handle); int32 = class(handle)
%
%   the call:
%
%      cspice_ckcls( handle )
%
%   closes the file indicated by 'handle'. The close operation
%   tests the file to ensure the presence of data segments.
%
%-Examples
%
%   Any numerical results shown for this example may differ between
%   platforms as the results depend on the SPICE kernels used as input
%   and the machine specific arithmetic implementation.
%
%      %
%      % Define needed parameters, a name for the CK, the
%      % file internal name, and the number of characters
%      % to reserve for a comment block.
%      %
%      CK1        = 'type1.bc';
%      IFNAME     = 'CK';
%      NCOMCH     = 10;
%
%      %
%      % Open a new kernel.
%      %
%       handle = cspice_ckopn( CK1, IFNAME, NCOMCH);
%
%         ... do some writes to the open CK file ...
%
%      %
%      % SAFELY close the file
%      %
%      cspice_ckcls( handle )
%
%-Particulars
%
%   A cspice_ckcls call should balance every cspice_ckopn
%   call.
%
%-Required Reading
%
%   For important details concerning this module's function, please refer to
%   the CSPICE routine ckcls_c.

%
%   -Mice Version 1.1.1, 29-OCT-2014, EDW (JPL)
%
%       Edited I/O section to conform to NAIF standard for Mice documentation.
%
%   -Mice Version 1.1.0, 22-JUL-2009, EDW (JPL)
%
%      Corrected the function definition name. This wrapper had a
%      the function name "cspice_ckopn" instead of "cspice_ckcls."
