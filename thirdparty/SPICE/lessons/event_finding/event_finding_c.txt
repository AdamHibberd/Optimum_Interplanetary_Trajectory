 
Geometric Event Finding Hands-On Lesson, using MEX (C)
===========================================================================
 
   November 02, 2017
 
 
Overview
--------------------------------------------------------
 
   This lesson illustrates how the Geometry Finder (GF) subsystem of the
   CSPICE Toolkit can be used to find time intervals when specified
   geometric conditions are satisfied.
 
   In this lesson the student is asked to construct a program that finds
   the time intervals, within a specified time range, when the Mars Express
   Orbiter (MEX) is visible from the DSN station DSS-14. Possible
   occultation of the spacecraft by Mars is to be considered.
 
 
Note About HTML Links
--------------------------------------------------------
 
   The HTML version of this lesson contains links pointing to various HTML
   documents provided with the Toolkit. All of these links are relative
   and, in order to function, require this document to be in a certain
   location in the Toolkit HTML documentation directory tree.
 
   In order for the links to be resolved, if not done already by installing
   the lessons package under the Toolkit's ``doc/html'' directory, create a
   subdirectory called ``lessons'' under the ``doc/html'' directory of the
   ``cspice/'' tree and copy this document to that subdirectory before
   loading it into a Web browser.
 
 
References
--------------------------------------------------------
 
   This section lists SPICE documents referred to in this lesson.
 
   Of these documents, the ``Tutorials'' contains the highest level
   descriptions with the least number of details while the ``Required
   Reading'' documents contain much more detailed specifications. The most
   complete specifications are provided in the ``API Documentation''.
 
   In some cases the lesson explanations also refer to the information
   provided in the meta-data area of the kernels used in the lesson
   examples. It is especially true in case of the FK and IK files, which
   often contain comprehensive descriptions of the frames, instrument FOVs,
   etc. Since both FK and IK are text kernels, the information provided in
   them can be viewed using any text editor, while the meta information
   provided in binary kernels -- SPKs and CKs -- can be viewed using
   ``commnt'' or ``spacit'' utility programs located in ``cspice/exe'' of
   Toolkit installation tree.

Find View Periods
===========================================================================
 
 
Task Statement
--------------------------------------------------------
 
   Write a program that finds the set of time intervals, within the time
   range
 
      2004 MAY 2 TDB
      2004 MAY 6 TDB
 
   when the Mars Express Orbiter (MEX) is visible from the DSN station
   DSS-14. These time intervals are frequently called ``view periods.''
 
   The spacecraft is considered visible if its apparent position (that is,
   its position corrected for light time and stellar aberration) has
   elevation of at least 6 degrees in the topocentric reference frame
   DSS-14_TOPO. In this exercise, we ignore the possibility of occultation
   of the spacecraft by Mars.
 
   Use a search step size that ensures that no view periods of duration 5
   minutes or longer will be missed by the search.
 
   Display the start and stop times of these intervals using TDB calendar
   dates and millisecond precision.
 
 
Learning Goals
--------------------------------------------------------
 
   Exposure to SPICE GF event finding routines. Familiarity with SPICE
   windows and routines that manipulate them. Exposure to SPICE time
   parsing and output formatting routines.
 
 
Approach
--------------------------------------------------------
 
 
Solution steps
 
   A possible solution could consist of the following steps:
 
   Preparation:
 
       1.   Review the CSPICE cell and window Required Reading.
 
       2.   Decide what SPICE kernels are necessary. Use the SPICE summary
            tool BRIEF to examine the coverage of the binary kernels and
            verify the availability of required data.
 
       3.   Create a meta-kernel listing the SPICE kernels to be loaded.
            (Hint: consult a programming example tutorial, or the
            Introduction to Kernels tutorial, for a reminder of how to do
            this.)
 
            Name the meta-kernel 'viewpr.tm'.
 
   Next, write a program that performs the following steps:
 
       1.   Use furnsh_c to load the meta-kernel.
 
       2.   Declare confinement and output CSPICE windows using
            SPICEDOUBLE_CELL.
 
       3.   Insert the given time bounds into the confinement window using
            wninsd_c.
 
       4.   Select a step size for searching for visibility state
            transitions: in this case, each target rise or set event is a
            state transition.
 
            The step size must be large enough so the search proceeds with
            reasonable speed, but small enough so that no visibility
            transition events---that is, target rise or set events---are
            missed.
 
       5.   Use the GF routine gfposc_c to find the window of times, within
            the confinement window, during which the MEX spacecraft is
            above the elevation limit as seen from DSN station DSS-14, in
            the the reference frame DSS-14_TOPO.
 
            Use light time and stellar aberration corrections for the
            apparent position of the spacecraft as seen from the station.
 
       6.   Fetch and display the contents of the result window. Use
            wnfetd_c to extract from the result window the start and stop
            times of each time interval. Display each of the intervals in
            the result window as a pair of start and stop times. Express
            each time as a TDB calendar date using the routine timout_c.
 
   You may find it useful to consult the references listed above. In
   particular, the header of the SPICE GF function gfposc_c contains
   pertinent documentation.

Find Times when Target is Visible
===========================================================================
 
 
Task Statement
--------------------------------------------------------
 
   Extend the program of the previous chapter to find times when the MEX
   orbiter is:
 
       --   Above the elevation limit in the DSS-14_TOPO topocentric
            reference frame.
 
       --   and is not occulted by Mars
 
   Finding time intervals that satisfy the second condition requires a
   search for occultations of the spacecraft by Mars. Perform this search
   twice: once using an ellipsoidal shape model for Mars, and once using a
   DSK shape model.
 
   Compute the final results twice as well, using the results of both
   occultation searches.
 
   For each of the two shape model cases, store the set of time intervals
   when the spacecraft is visible in a CSPICE window. We'll call this the
   ``result window.''
 
   Display each of the intervals in each result window as a pair of start
   and stop times. Express each time as a TDB calendar date using the same
   format as in the previous program.
 
 
Learning Goals
--------------------------------------------------------
 
   Familiarity with the GF occultation finding routine gfoclt_c. Experience
   with Digital Shape Kernel (DSK) shape models. Further experience with
   the CSPICE window functions.
 
 
Approach
--------------------------------------------------------
 
 
Solution steps
 
   A possible solution would consist of the following steps:
 
       1.   Use the meta-kernel from the previous chapter as the starting
            point. Add more kernels to it as needed.
 
            Name the meta-kernel 'visibl.tm'.
 
       2.   Include the code from the program of the previous chapter in a
            new source file; modify this code to create the new program.
 
       3.   Your program will need additional windows to capture the
            results of occultation searches performed using both
            ellipsoidal and DSK shape models. Additional windows will be
            needed to compute the set differences of the elevation search
            (``view period'') window and each of the occultation search
            windows. Further details are provided below.
 
            Declare additional output CSPICE windows using
            SPICEDOUBLE_CELL.
 
       4.   The remaining steps can be performed twice: once using an
            ellipsoidal shape model for Mars, and once using a DSK Mars
            shape model. Alternatively, two copies of the entire solution
            program can be created: one for each shape model.
 
       5.   Search for occultations of the MEX orbiter as seen from DSS-14
            using gfoclt_c. Use as the confinement window for this search
            the result window from the elevation search performed by
            gfposc_c.
 
            Since occultations occur when the apparent MEX spacecraft
            position is behind the apparent figure of Mars, light time
            correction must be performed for the occultation search. To
            improve accuracy of the occultation state determination, use
            ``converged Newtonian'' light time correction.
 
       6.   Use the CSPICE window subtraction routine wndifd_c to subtract
            the window of times when the spacecraft is occulted from the
            window of times when the spacecraft is above the elevation
            limit. The difference window is the final result.
 
       7.   Modify the code to display the contents of the difference
            window.
 
   This completes the assignment.

Extra Credit
===========================================================================
 
   In this ``extra credit'' section you will be presented with more complex
   tasks, aimed at improving your understanding of the geometry event
   finding subsystem and particularly the gfposc_c and gfdist_c functions.
 
   These ``extra credit'' tasks are provided as task statements, and unlike
   the regular tasks, no approach or solution source code is provided. In
   the next section, you will find the numeric solutions to the questions
   asked in these tasks.
