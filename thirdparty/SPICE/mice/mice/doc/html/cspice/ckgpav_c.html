   inst       is the NAIF integer ID for the instrument, spacecraft, or
              other structure for which pointing and angular velocity
              are requested. For brevity we will refer to this object
              as the &quot;instrument,&quot; and the frame fixed to this object
              as the &quot;instrument frame&quot; or &quot;instrument-fixed&quot; frame.
 
   sclkdp     is the encoded spacecraft clock time for which 
              pointing and angular velocity are requested.  

              The CSPICE routines <a href="scencd_c.html">scencd_c</a> and <a href="sce2c_c.html">sce2c_c</a> respectively
              convert spacecraft clock strings and ephemeris time
              to encoded spacecraft clock.  The inverse conversions
              are performed by <a href="scdecd_c.html">scdecd_c</a> and <a href="sct2e_c.html">sct2e_c</a>.
 
   tol        is a time tolerance in ticks, the units of encoded 
              spacecraft clock time.  

              The CSPICE routine <a href="sctiks_c.html">sctiks_c</a> converts a spacecraft clock
              tolerance duration from its character string
              representation to ticks.  <a href="scfmt_c.html">scfmt_c</a> performs the inverse
              conversion.
 
              The C-matrix - angular velocity vector pair returned by
              <b>ckgpav_c</b> is the one whose time tag is closest to `sclkdp'
              and within `tol' units of `sclkdp'.  (More in
              Particulars, below.)
 
              In general, because using a non-zero tolerance 
              affects selection of the segment from which the
              data is obtained, users are strongly discouraged 
              from using a non-zero tolerance when reading CKs 
              with continuous data. Using a non-zero tolerance
              should be reserved exclusively to reading CKs with 
              discrete data because in practice obtaining data 
              from such CKs using a zero tolerance is often not 
              possible due to time round off. 

   ref        is the desired reference frame for the returned pointing
              and angular velocity. The returned C-matrix `cmat' gives
              the orientation of the instrument designated by `inst'
              relative to the frame designated by `ref'.  When a vector
              specified relative to frame `ref' is left-multiplied by
              `cmat', the vector is rotated to the frame associated
              with `inst'.  The returned angular velocity vector `av'
              expresses the angular velocity of the instrument
              designated by `inst' relative to the frame designated by
              `ref'.  See the discussion of `cmat' and `av' below 
              for details.

              Consult the SPICE document &quot;Frames&quot; for a discussion 
              of supported reference frames. 
 </PRE>
<h4><a name="Detailed_Output">Detailed_Output</a></h4>
<PRE>
 
   cmat       is a rotation matrix that transforms the components of a
              vector expressed in the frame specified by `ref' to
              components expressed in the frame tied to the instrument,
              spacecraft, or other structure at time `clkout' (see
              below). 

              Thus, if a vector v has components x,y,z in the `ref'
              reference frame, then v has components x',y',z' in the 
              instrument fixed frame at time `clkout': 
 
                   [ x' ]     [          ] [ x ] 
                   | y' |  =  |   cmat   | | y | 
                   [ z' ]     [          ] [ z ] 
 
              If you know x', y', z', use the transpose of the 
              C-matrix to determine x, y, z as follows: 
 
                   [ x ]      [          ]T    [ x' ] 
                   | y |  =   |   cmat   |     | y' | 
                   [ z ]      [          ]     [ z' ] 
                           (Transpose of cmat) 
 

   av         is the angular velocity vector.  This is the axis about
              which the reference frame tied to the instrument is
              rotating in the right-handed sense at time `clkout'. The
              magnitude of `av' is the magnitude of the instantaneous
              velocity of the rotation, in radians per second. 
              The components of `av' are given relative to the
              reference frame specified by the input argument `ref'.

   clkout     is the encoded spacecraft clock time associated with
              the returned C-matrix and the returned angular
              velocity vector. This value may differ from the
              requested time, but never by more than the input
              tolerance `tol'.
 
              The particulars section below describes the search 
              algorithm used by <b>ckgpav_c</b> to satisfy a pointing request. 
              This algorithm determines the pointing instance 
              (and therefore the associated time value) that is 
              returned. 
 
   found      is SPICETRUE if a record was found to satisfy the
              pointing request.  `found' will be SPICEFALSE otherwise.

   How the tolerance argument is used
   ==================================


   Reading a type 1 CK segment (discrete pointing instances)
   ---------------------------------------------------------

   In the diagram below
  
      - &quot;0&quot; is used to represent discrete pointing instances 
        (quaternions, angular velocity vectors, and associated 
        time tags).

      - &quot;( )&quot; are used to represent the end points of the time
        interval covered by a segment in a CK file.
      
      - `sclkdp' is the time at which you requested pointing.
        The location of `sclkdp' relative to the time tags of the
        pointing instances is indicated by the &quot;+&quot; sign.

      - `tol' is the time tolerance specified in the pointing
        request.  The square brackets &quot;[ ]&quot; represent the 
        endpoints of the time interval 

           sclkdp-tol : sclkdp+tol

      - The quaternions occurring in the segment need not be
        evenly spaced in time.


   Case 1:  pointing is available
   ------------------------------

                            sclkdp 
                                 \   tol 
                                  | / 
                                  |/\

                               .  .  . 
   Segment      (0-----0--0--0--0--0--0---0--0------------0--0--0--0)

                       <b>ckgpav_c</b> returns this instance.


   Case 2:  pointing is not available
   ----------------------------------

                                                 sclkdp

   Segment      (0-----0--0--0--0--0--0---0--0--0---------0--0--0--0) 

                      
                       <b>ckgpav_c</b> returns no pointing; the output 
                       `found' flag is set to SPICEFALSE.



   Reading a type 2, 3, 4, or 5 CK segment (continuous pointing)
   -------------------------------------------------------------

   In the diagrams below
  
      - &quot;==&quot; is used to represent periods of continuous pointing. 

      - &quot;--&quot; is used to represent gaps in the pointing coverage. 

      - &quot;( )&quot; are used to represent the end points of the time
        interval covered by a segment in a CK file.
      
      - `sclkdp' is the time at which you requested pointing.
        The location of `sclkdp' relative to the time tags of the
        pointing instances is indicated by the &quot;+&quot; sign.

      - `tol' is the time tolerance specified in the pointing
        request.  The square brackets &quot;[ ]&quot; represent the 
        endpoints of the time interval 

           sclkdp-tol : sclkdp+tol

      - The quaternions occurring in the periods of continuous
        pointing need not be evenly spaced in time.


   Case 1:  pointing is available at the request time
   --------------------------------------------------
 
                           sclkdp 
                                 \   tol 
                                  | /

                                  | 

                 The request time lies within an interval where
                 continuous pointing is available. <b>ckgpav_c</b> returns
                 pointing at the requested epoch.


   Case 2:  pointing is available &quot;near&quot; the request time
   ------------------------------------------------------
 
                                  sclkdp 
                                        \   tol

                 The request time lies in a gap:  an interval where
                 continuous pointing is *not* available.  <b>ckgpav_c</b>

                       `found' flag is set to SPICEFALSE.



   Tolerance and segment priority
   ==============================

   <b>ckgpav_c</b> searches through loaded C-kernels to satisfy a pointing
   request. Last-loaded files are searched first. Individual files are
   searched in backwards order, so that between competing segments
   (segments containing data for the same object, for overlapping time
   ranges), the one closest to the end of the file has highest
   priority. <b>ckgpav_c</b> considers only those segments that contain both
   pointing and angular velocity data, as indicated by the segment
   descriptor.
 
   The search ends when a segment is found that can provide pointing
   and angular velocity for the specified instrument at a time
   falling within the specified tolerance on either side of the
   request time. Within that segment, the instance closest to the       
   input time is located and returned.
 
   The following four cases illustrate this search procedure. Segments 
   A and B are in the same file, with segment A located further 
   towards the end of the file than segment B. Both segments A and B 
   contain discrete pointing data, indicated by the number 0.
 

   Case 1:  Pointing is available in the first segment searched.
            Because segment A has the highest priority and can
            satisfy the request, segment B is not searched.

   Segments that contain continuous pointing data are searched in the
   same manner as segments containing discrete pointing data. For
   request times that fall within the bounds of continuous intervals,
   <b>ckgpav_c</b> will return pointing at the request time. When the request
   time does not fall within an interval, then a time at an endpoint of
   an interval may be returned if it is the closest time in the segment
   to the user request time and is also within the tolerance.
 
   In the following examples, segment A is located further towards the
   end of the file than segment C. Segment A contains discrete pointing
   data and segment C contains continuous data, indicated by the &quot;=&quot;
   character.
 

   Case 3:  Pointing is not available in the first segment searched.
            Because segment A cannot satisfy the request, segment C
            is searched.

   In the next case, assume that the order of segments A and C in the
   file is reversed:  A is now closer to the front, so data from
   segment C are considered first.


   Case 4:  Pointing is available in the first segment searched.
            Because segment C has the highest priority and can
            satisfy the request, segment A is not searched.

   The next case illustrates an unfortunate side effect of using 
   a non-zero tolerance when reading multi-segment CKs with
   continuous data. In all cases when the look-up interval 
   formed using tolerance overlaps a segment boundary and 
   the request time falls within the coverage of the lower 
   priority segment, the data at the end of the higher priority
   segment will be picked instead of the data from the lower 
   priority segment.


   Case 5:  Pointing is available in the first segment searched.
            Because segment C has the highest priority and can
            satisfy the request, segment A is not searched.

   Suppose you have two C-kernel files containing pointing for the
   Voyager 2 narrow angle camera.  One file contains predict (planned)
   values, and the other contains corrected pointing for a selected
   group of images, that is, for a subset of images from the first
   file.
 
   The following example program uses <b>ckgpav_c</b> to get C-matrices and
   associated angular velocity vectors for a set of images whose
   SCLK counts (un-encoded character string versions) are contained
   in the array `sclkch'.

   If available, the program will get the corrected pointing values.
   Otherwise, predict values will be used.

   For each C-matrix, a unit pointing vector is constructed and printed
   along with the angular velocity vector.
 
   Note: if the C-kernels of interest do not contain angular velocity
   data, then the CSPICE routine <a href="ckgp_c.html">ckgp_c</a> should be used to read the
   pointing data.  An example program in the header of the CSPICE
   routine <a href="ckgp_c.html">ckgp_c</a> demonstrates this.

            spacecraft is -32001.
      
        --  Spacecraft clock times for successive Voyager images always
            differ by more than 0:0:400.  This is an acceptable
            tolerance, and must be converted to &quot;ticks&quot; (units of
