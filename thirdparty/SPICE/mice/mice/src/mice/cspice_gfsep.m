%-I/O
%
%   Given:
%
%      Parameters-
%
%      All parameters described here are declared in the header file
%      SpiceGF.h. See that file for parameter values.
%
%      SPICE_GF_CNVTOL
%
%               is the convergence tolerance used for finding endpoints of
%               the intervals comprising the result window.
%               SPICE_GF_CNVTOL is used to determine when binary searches
%               for roots should terminate: when a root is bracketed
%               within an interval of length SPICE_GF_CNVTOL, the root is
%               considered to have been found.
%
%               The accuracy, as opposed to precision, of roots found
%               by this routine depends on the accuracy of the input
%               data. In most cases, the accuracy of solutions will be
%               inferior to their precision.
%
%      Arguments-
%
%      targ1    the name of the first body of interest. You can
%               also supply the integer ID code for the object as an
%               integer string.  For example both 'MOON' and '301'
%               are legitimate strings that indicate the moon is the
%               target body.
%
%               [1,c1] = size(targ1); char = class(targ1)
%

%               [1,1] = size(targ1); cell = class(targ1)
%
%      shape1   the name of the geometric model used to represent the shape

%
%               The 'abcorr' string lacks sensitivity to case, and to embedded,
%               leading and trailing blanks.
%
%      obsrvr   the name of the observing body. Optionally, you
%               may supply the ID code of the object as an integer
%               string. For example, both 'EARTH' and '399' are
%               legitimate strings to supply to indicate the
%               observer is Earth.
%
%               [1,c8] = size(obsrvr); char = class(obsrvr)

%      relate   the constraint relational operator on the angular separation.
%               The result window found by this routine indicates the time
%               intervals where the constraint is satisfied. 
%
%               [1,c9] = size(relate); char = class(relate)
%
%                  or
%
%               [1,1] = size(relate); cell = class(relate)
%
%
%               Supported values of relate and corresponding meanings are 
%               shown below:
%
%                  '>'      Separation is greater than the reference
%                           value 'refval'.
%
%                  '='      Separation is equal to the reference
%                           value 'refval'.
%
%                  '<'      Separation is less than the reference
%                           value 'refval'.
%
%                  'ABSMAX'  Separation is at an absolute maximum.
%
%                  'ABSMIN'  Separation is at an absolute  minimum.
%
%                  'LOCMAX'  Separation is at a local maximum.
%
%                  'LOCMIN'  Separation is at a local minimum.
%
%               The caller may indicate that the region of interest
%               is the set of time intervals where the quantity is
%               within a specified angular separation of an absolute extremum.
%               The argument adjust (described below) is used to
%               specify this angular separation.
%
%               Local extrema are considered to exist only in the
%               interiors of the intervals comprising the confinement
%               window:  a local extremum cannot exist at a boundary
%               point of the confinement window.
%
%               Negative Angular Separation
%
%                  For those searches using a SPHERE shape identifier for
%                  either target body, the angular separation function
%                  returns a negative value when the bodies overlap (occult).
%
%               The 'relate' string lacks sensitivity to case, leading
%               and trailing blanks.
%
%      refval   reference value used together with 'relate' argument to define
%               an equality or inequality to be satisfied by the angular
%               separation between the specified target and observer. See
%               the discussion of relate above for further information.
%
%               [1,1] = size(refval); double = class(refval)
%
%               The units of 'refval' are radians.
%
%      adjust   value used to modify searches for absolute extrema: when
%               'relate' is set to ABSMAX or ABSMIN and adjust is set to a
%               positive value, cspice_gfsep finds times when the angular
%               separation between the bodies is within adjust
%               radians of the specified extreme value.
%
%               [1,1] = size(adjust); double = class(adjust)
%
%               For relate set to ABSMAX, the result window contains
%               time intervals when the angular separation has
%               values between ABSMAX - 'adjust' and ABSMAX.
%
%               For relate set to ABSMIN, the result window contains
%               time intervals when the angular separation has
%               values between ABSMIN and ABSMIN + 'adjust'.
%
%               'adjust' is not used for searches for local extrema,
%               equality or inequality conditions.
%
%      step     time step size to use in the search. 'step' must be short
%               enough for a search using this step size to locate the time
%               intervals where coordinate function of the observer-target
%               vector is monotone increasing or decreasing. However, step must
%               not be *too* short, or the search will take an unreasonable
%               amount of time.
%
%               [1,1] = size(step); double = class(step)
%
%               The choice of step affects the completeness but not
%               the precision of solutions found by this routine; the
%               precision is controlled by the convergence tolerance.
%               See the discussion of the parameter SPICE_GF_CNVTOL for
%               details.
%
%               'step' has units of TDB seconds.
%
%      nintvls  value specifying the number of intervals in the internal
%               workspace array used by this routine. 'nintvls' should be at
%               least as large as the number of intervals within the search
%               region on which the specified observer-target vector coordinate
%               function is monotone increasing or decreasing. It does no harm
%               to pick a value of 'nintvls' larger than the minimum required
%               to execute the specified search, but if chosen too small, the
%               search will fail.
%
%               [1,1] = size(nintvls); int32 = class(nintvls)
%
%      cnfine   a SPICE window that confines the time period over which the
%               specified search is conducted. 'cnfine' may consist of a
%               single interval or a collection of intervals.
%
%               [2m,1] = size(cnfine); double = class(cnfine)
%
%               In some cases the confinement window can be used to
%               greatly reduce the time period that must be searched
%               for the desired solution. See the Particulars section
%               below for further discussion.
%
%               See the Examples section below for a code example
%               that shows how to create a confinement window.
%
%   the call:
%
%      result = cspice_gfsep( targ1,  shape1, frame1,          ...
%                             targ2,  shape2, frame2,          ...
%                             abcorr, obsrvr, relate,  refval, ...
%                             adjust, step,   nintvls, cnfine )
%
%   returns:
%
%      result   the SPICE window of intervals, contained within the
%               confinement window 'cnfine', on which the specified
%               constraint is satisfied.
%
%               [2n,1] = size(result); double = class(result)
%
%               If the search is for local extrema, or for absolute
%               extrema with adjust set to zero, then normally each
%               interval of result will be a singleton: the left and
%               right endpoints of each interval will be identical.
%
%               If no times within the confinement window satisfy the
%               constraint, 'result' will return with cardinality zero.

%-Particulars
%
%   This routine provides a simple interface for conducting searches
%   for angular separation events.
%
%   This routine determines a set of one or more time intervals
%   within the confinement window for which the angular separation
%   between the two bodies satisfies some defined relationship.
%   The resulting set of intervals is returned as a SPICE window.
%
%   Below we discuss in greater detail aspects of this routine's
%   solution process that are relevant to correct and efficient
%   use of this routine in user applications.
%
%   The Search Process
%   ==================
%
%   Regardless of the type of constraint selected by the caller, this
%   routine starts the search for solutions by determining the time
%   periods, within the confinement window, over which the specified
%   angular separation function is monotone increasing and monotone
%   decreasing. Each of these time periods is represented by a SPICE window.
%   Having found these windows, all of the angular separation function's
%   local extrema within the confinement window are known. Absolute extrema
%   then can be found very easily.
%
%   Within any interval of these "monotone" windows, there will be at
%   most one solution of any equality constraint. Since the boundary
%   of the solution set for any inequality constraint is contained in
%   the union of
%
%      - the set of points where an equality constraint is met
%      - the boundary points of the confinement window
%
%   the solutions of both equality and inequality constraints can be
%   found easily once the monotone windows have been found.
%
%   Step Size
%   =========
%
%   The monotone windows (described above) are found using a two-step
%   search process. Each interval of the confinement window is
%   searched as follows: first, the input step size is used to
%   determine the time separation at which the sign of the rate of
%   change of angular separation (angular separation rate) will be
%   sampled. Starting at the left endpoint of an interval, samples
%   will be taken at each step. If a change of sign is found, a
%   root has been bracketed; at that point, the time at which the
%   angular separation rate is zero can be found by a refinement
%   process, for example, using a binary search.
%
%   Note that the optimal choice of step size depends on the lengths
%   of the intervals over which the distance function is monotone:
%   the step size should be shorter than the shortest of these
%   intervals (within the confinement window).
%
%   The optimal step size is *not* necessarily related to the lengths
%   of the intervals comprising the result window. For example, if
%   the shortest monotone interval has length 10 days, and if the
%   shortest result window interval has length 5 minutes, a step size
%   of 9.9 days is still adequate to find all of the intervals in the
%   result window. In situations like this, the technique of using
%   monotone windows yields a dramatic efficiency improvement over a
%   state-based search that simply tests at each step whether the
%   specified constraint is satisfied. The latter type of search can
%   miss solution intervals if the step size is longer than the
%   shortest solution interval.
%
%   Having some knowledge of the relative geometry of the target and
%   observer can be a valuable aid in picking a reasonable step size.
%   In general, the user can compensate for lack of such knowledge by
%   picking a very short step size; the cost is increased computation
%   time.
%
%   Note that the step size is not related to the precision with which
%   the endpoints of the intervals of the result window are computed.
%   That precision level is controlled by the convergence tolerance.
%
%   Convergence Tolerance
%   =====================
%
%   As described above, the root-finding process used by this routine
%   involves first bracketing roots and then using a search process
%   to locate them. "Roots" are both times when local extrema are
%   attained and times when the distance function is equal to a
%   reference value. All endpoints of the intervals comprising the
%   result window are either endpoints of intervals of the
%   confinement window or roots.
%
%   Once a root has been bracketed, a refinement process is used to
%   narrow down the time interval within which the root must lie.
%   This refinement process terminates when the location of the root
%   has been determined to within an error margin called the
%   "convergence tolerance." The convergence tolerance used by this
%   routine is set by the parameter SPICE_GF_CNVTOL.
%
%   The value of SPICE_GF_CNVTOL is set to a "tight" value so that the
%   tolerance doesn't become the limiting factor in the accuracy of
%   solutions found by this routine. In general the accuracy of input
%   data will be the limiting factor.
%
%   The user may change the convergence tolerance from the default
%   SPICE_GF_CNVTOL value by calling the routine cspice_gfstol, e.g.
%
%      cspice_gfstol( tolerance value in seconds )
%
%   Call cspice_gfstol prior to calling this routine. All subsequent
%   searches will use the updated tolerance value.
%
%   Setting the tolerance tighter than SPICE_GF_CNVTOL is unlikely to be
%   useful, since the results are unlikely to be more accurate.
%   Making the tolerance looser will speed up searches somewhat,
%   since a few convergence steps will be omitted. However, in most
%   cases, the step size is likely to have a much greater affect on
%   processing time than would the convergence tolerance.
%
%   The Confinement Window
%   ======================
%
%   The simplest use of the confinement window is to specify a time
%   interval within which a solution is sought. However, the
%   confinement window can, in some cases, be used to make searches
%   more efficient. Sometimes it's possible to do an efficient search
%   to reduce the size of the time period over which a relatively
%   slow search of interest must be performed.
%
%   Elongation
%   ===========================
%
%   The angular separation of two targets as seen from an observer
%   where one of those targets is the sun is known as elongation.
