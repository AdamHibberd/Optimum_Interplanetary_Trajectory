%             The shape of the spheroid is defined by an equatorial radius `re'
%             and a polar radius `rp'.

%             where rp is the polar radius of the spheroid. (More importantly

%
%-Particulars
%
%   When performing vector calculations with velocities it is usually
%   most convenient to work in rectangular coordinates. However, once
%   the vector manipulations have been performed, it is often
%   desirable to convert the rectangular representations into
%   planetographic coordinates to gain insights about phenomena in
%   this coordinate frame.
%
%   To transform rectangular velocities to derivatives of coordinates
%   in a planetographic system, one uses the Jacobian of the
%   transformation between the two systems.
%
%   Given a state in rectangular coordinates
%
%      ( x, y, z, dx, dy, dz )
%
%   the velocity in planetographic coordinates is given by the matrix
%   equation:
%                        t          |                     t
%      (dlon, dlat, dalt)   = jacobi|       * (dx, dy, dz)
%                                   |(x,y,z)
%
%   This routine computes the matrix
%
%            |
%      jacobi|
%            |(x, y, z)
%
%
%   The planetographic definition of latitude is identical to the
%   planetodetic (also called "geodetic" in SPICE documentation)
%   definition. In the planetographic coordinate system, latitude is
%   defined using a reference spheroid.  The spheroid is
%   characterized by an equatorial radius and a polar radius. For a
%   point P on the spheroid, latitude is defined as the angle between
%   the X-Y plane and the outward surface normal at P.  For a point P
%   off the spheroid, latitude is defined as the latitude of the
%   nearest point to P on the spheroid.  Note if P is an interior
%   point, for example, if P is at the center of the spheroid, there
%   may not be a unique nearest point to P.
%
%   In the planetographic coordinate system, longitude is defined
%   using the spin sense of the body.  Longitude is positive to the
%   west if the spin is prograde and positive to the east if the spin
%   is retrograde.  The spin sense is given by the sign of the first
%   degree term of the time-dependent polynomial for the body's prime
%   meridian Euler angle "W":  the spin is retrograde if this term is
%   negative and prograde otherwise.  For the sun, planets, most
%   natural satellites, and selected asteroids, the polynomial
%   expression for W may be found in a SPICE PCK kernel.
%
%   The earth, moon, and sun are exceptions: planetographic longitude
%   is measured positive east for these bodies.
%
%   If you wish to override the default sense of positive longitude
%   for a particular body, you can do so by defining the kernel
%   variable
%
%      BODY<body ID>_PGR_POSITIVE_LON
%
%   where <body ID> represents the NAIF ID code of the body. This
%   variable may be assigned either of the values
%
%      'WEST'
%      'EAST'
%
%   For example, you can have this routine treat the longitude
%   of the earth as increasing to the west using the kernel
%   variable assignment
%
%      BODY399_PGR_POSITIVE_LON = 'WEST'
%
%   Normally such assignments are made by placing them in a text
%   kernel and loading that kernel via cspice_furnsh.
%
%   The definition of this kernel variable controls the behavior of
%   the CSPICE planetographic routines
%
%      cspice_pgrrec
%      cspice_recpgr
%      cspice_dpgrdr
%      cspice_drdpgr
%
%   It does not affect the other CSPICE coordinate conversion
%   routines.
