# Optimum_Interplanetary_Trajectory
Calculates optimum interplanetary trajectories visitng a specifed sequence of planets or other celestial bodies.
This Software uses the NASA SPICE toolkit as a source for positions/velocities of celestial bodies as a function of time.
It also uses the NOMAD Non-Linear Global Optimization Software which allows inequality constraints
