%
%-I/O
%
%   Given:
%
%      file   the name of a kernel file for which descriptive
%             information is desired.
%
%             [1,c1] = size(file); char = class(file)
%
%                or
%
%             [1,1] = size(file); cell = class(file)
%
%   the call:
%
%      [ filtyp, source, handle, found] = cspice_kinfo( file)
%
%   returns:
%
%      filtyp   the type name of the kernel specified by 'file'.
%               'filtyp' will be empty if file is not on the list of kernels
%               loaded via cspice_furnsh.
%
%               [1,c2] = size(file); char = class(file)
%
%      source   the name of the source file used to
%               specify 'file' as one to load.  If 'file' was loaded
%               directly via a call to cspice_furnsh, 'source' will be empty.
%               If file is not on the list of kernels loaded via
%               cspice_furnsh, 'source' will be empty.
%
%               [1,c3] = size(file); char = class(file)
%
%      handle   the integer handle attached to 'file' if it is a binary
%               kernel.  If file is a text kernel or meta-text kernel
%               handle will be zero. If file is not on the list of
%               kernels loaded via cspice_furnsh, 'handle' has value zero.
%
%               [1,1] = size(handle); int32 = class(handle)
%
%      found    returns true if the specified file exists.
%               If there is no such file, 'found' will be set to
%               false.
%
%               [1,1] = size(found); logical = class(found)
%
%-Examples
%
%   Any numerical results shown for this example may differ between
%   platforms as the results depend on the SPICE kernels used as input
%   and the machine specific arithmetic implementation.
%
%      Use the meta-kernel shown below to load the required SPICE
%      kernels.
%
%         KPL/MK
%
%         This meta-kernel is intended to support operation of SPICE
%         example programs. The kernels shown here should not be
%         assumed to contain adequate or correct versions of data
%         required by SPICE-based user applications.
%
%         In order for an application to use this meta-kernel, the
%         kernels referenced here must be present in the user's
%         current working directory.
%
%         The names and contents of the kernels referenced
%         by this meta-kernel are as follows:
%
%            File name                     Contents
%            ---------                     --------
%            de421.bsp                     Planetary ephemeris
%            pck00009.tpc                  Planet orientation and
%                                          radii
%            naif0009.tls                  Leapseconds
