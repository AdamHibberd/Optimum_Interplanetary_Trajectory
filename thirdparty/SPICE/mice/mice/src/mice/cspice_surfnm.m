%-I/O
%
%   Given:
%
%      a,
%      b,      
%      c       the values of the ellipsoid's triaxial radii ellipsoid, where:
%
%                 'a' is length in kilometers of the semi-axis of the ellipsoid
%                 parallel to the x-axis of the body-fixed reference frame
%
%                 'b' is length in kilometers of the semi-axis of the ellipsoid
%                 parallel to the y-axis of the body-fixed reference frame
%
%                 'c' is length in kilometers of the semi-axis of the ellipsoid
%                 parallel to the z-axis of the body-fixed reference frame
%
%              [1,1] = size(a); double = class(a)
%              [1,1] = size(b); double = class(b)
%              [1,1] = size(c); double = class(c)
%
%      point   location(s) on the ellipsoid.
%
%              [3,3]   = size(point); double = class(point)
%              
%              or     
%
%              [3,3,n] = size(point); double = class(point)
%
%   the call:
%
%      normal = cspice_surfnm( a, b, c, point)
%
%   returns:
%
%      normal   the unit normal(s) to the ellipsoid at 'point' in the direction
%               away from the ellipsoid
%
%               If    [3,3]   = size(point)
%               then  [3,3]   = size(normal); double = class(normal)
%
%               If    [3,3,n] = size(point)
%               then  [3,3,n] = size(normal); double = class(normal)
%
%               'normal' returns with the same vectorization measure, N,
%               as 'point'.
%
%-Examples
%
%   Any numerical results shown for this example may differ between
%   platforms as the results depend on the SPICE kernels used as input
%   and the machine specific arithmetic implementation.
%
%      %
%      % Define the radii of an ellipsoid.
%      %
%      a  =  1.;
%      b  =  2.;
%      c  =  3.;
%
%      %
%      % Select a set of locations, three 3-vectors.
%      %
%      point = [ [ 0.; 0.; 3.], [ 0.; 2.; 0.], [-1; 0; 0] ];
%
%      %
%      % Calculate the surface normal to the ellipsoid at 'point'.
%      %
%      out_norm = cspice_surfnm( a, b, c, point)
%
%   MATLAB outputs:
%
%      out_norm =
%
%           0     0    -1
%           0     1     0
%           1     0     0
%
%      Three 3-vectors:
%         the normal at (0,0,3) equals (0,0,1)
%         the normal at (0,2,0) equals (0,0,1)
%         the normal at (-1,0,0) equals (-1,0,0)
