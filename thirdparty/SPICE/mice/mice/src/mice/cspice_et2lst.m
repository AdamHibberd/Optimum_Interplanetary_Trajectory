%
%-I/O
%
%   Given:
%
%      et     the ephemeris time(s) expressed as ephemeris seconds past
%             J2000 at which a local time is desired.
%
%             [1,n] = size(et); double = class(et)
%
%      body   the SPICE ID-code of the body on which to measure local time.
%
%             [1,1] = size(body); int32 = class(body)
%
%      lon    longitude (either planetocentric or planetographic)
%             in radians of the site on the surface
%             of body for which local time should be computed.
%
%             [1,1] = size(lon); double = class(lon)
%
%      type   the name for the form of longitude supplied by the
%             variable 'lon'.
%
%             [1,c1] = size(type); char = class(type)
%
%                or
%
%             [1,1] = size(type); cell = class(type)
%
%             Allowed values are "PLANETOCENTRIC" and
%             "PLANETOGRAPHIC".  Note the case of the letters
%             in type is insignificant. Both "PLANETOCENTRIC"
%             and "planetocentric" are recognized.  Leading and
%             trailing blanks in type are not significant.
%
%   the call:
%
%      [ hr, min, sec, time, ampm] = cspice_et2lst( et, body, lon, type)
%
%   returns:
%
%      hr     the value(s) describing the integral number of the local
%             "hour" of the site specified at epoch 'et'.
%
%             [1,n] = size(et); double = class(et)
%
%             Note that an "hour" of local time does not have the same duration
%             as an hour measured by conventional clocks. It is simply a
%             representation of an angle.
%
%      mn     the value(s) describing the integral number of "minutes" past
%             the hour of the local time of the site at the epoch 'et'.
%
%             [1,n] = size(et); double = class(et)
%
%             Again note that a "local minute" is not the same as a minute you
%             would measure with conventional clocks.
%
%      sc     the value(s) describing the integral number of "seconds" past
%             the minute of the local time of the site at the epoch 'et'.
%
%             [1,n] = size(et); double = class(et)
%
%             Again note that a "local second" is not the same as a second
%             you would measure with conventional clocks.
%
%      time   the array of local time(s) on a "24 hour" local clock.
%
%             [n,c1] = size(segid); char = class(segid)
%
%      ampm   array of local time(s) on a "12 hour" local clock together
%             with the traditional AM/PM label to indicate whether the sun has
%             crossed the local zenith meridian.
%
%             [n,c2] = size(segid); char = class(segid)
%
%             All output arguments return with the same measure of
%             vectorization, N, as 'et'.
%
%-Examples
%
%   Any numerical results shown for this example may differ between
%   platforms as the results depend on the SPICE kernels used as input
%   and the machine specific arithmetic implementation.

%      % Load a leapseconds kernel.

%      utc                        = strvcat( '2002 SEP 02 00:00:00', ...
%                                            '2002 SEP 30 00:00:00' );

%      % It's always good form to unload kernels after use,
%      % particularly in MATLAB due to data persistence.
%      %
%      cspice_kclear
%
%   MATLAB outputs:
%
%      The local time at Mars 326.17 degrees E planetographic longitude:
