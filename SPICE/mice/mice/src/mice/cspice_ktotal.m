%
%-I/O
%
%   Given:
%
%     kind   a list of types of kernels to count when checking the
%            loaded kernels. 
%
%            [1,c1] = size(kind); char = class(kind)
%
%               or
%
%            [1,1] = size(kind); cell = class(kind)
%
%            'kind' should consist of a list of words of kernels to 
%            examine.  Recognized types are
%
%                 'SPK'  --- All SPK files are counted in the total.
%                 'CK'   --- All CK files are counted in the total. 
%                 'PCK'  --- All binary PCK files are counted in the 
%                          total. 
%                 'DSK'  --- All DSK files are counted in the total. 
%                 'EK'   --- All EK files are counted in the total. 
%                 'TEXT' --- All text kernels that are not meta-text. 
%                          kernels are included in the total. 
%                 'META' --- All meta-text kernels are counted in the 
%                          total. 
%                 'ALL'  --- Every type of kernel is counted in the 
%                          total. 
%
%            'kind' lacks case sensitivity. The cspice_ktotal algorithm ignores
%            words in 'kind' if not one of those listed above.
%
%            See the Examples section for illustrations of the
%            use of kind.
%
%   the call:
%
%      count = cspice_ktotal( kind )
%
%   returns:
%
%      count   the number of kernels loaded through cspice_furnsh 
%              belonging to the list specified by 'kind'.
%
%              [1,1] = size(count); double = class(count)
%
%-Examples
%
%   Any numerical results shown for this example may differ between
%   platforms as the results depend on the SPICE kernels used as input
%   and the machine specific arithmetic implementation.
%
%     %
%     % Load the standard meta kernel, retrieve the number of
%     % loaded kernels.
%     %
%     cspice_furnsh( 'standard.tm' )
%
%     n   = cspice_ktotal( 'ALL' );
%     txt = sprintf('Count of loaded kernels before cspice_kclear call: %d', n);
%     disp( txt )
%
%   MATLAB outputs:
%
%     Count of loaded kernels before cspice_kclear call: 4
%
%   The expected result counting standard.tm and the three kernels
%   named in the meta kernel.
%
%     %
%     % Clear the KEEPER system, retrieve the number of loaded
%     % after the clear.
%     %
%     cspice_kclear
%
%     n   = cspice_ktotal( 'ALL' );
%     txt = sprintf('Count of loaded kernels after cspice_kclear call: %d', n);
%     disp( txt )
%
%   MATLAB outputs:
%
%     Count of loaded kernels after cspice_kclear call: 0
