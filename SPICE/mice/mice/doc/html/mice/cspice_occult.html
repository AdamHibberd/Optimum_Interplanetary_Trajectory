   CSPICE_OCCULT determines the occultation condition (not occulted,
   partially, etc.) of one target relative to another target as seen
   by an observer at a given time.

   The surfaces of the target bodies may be represented by triaxial
   ellipsoids or by topographic data provided by DSK files.

</pre><h4><a name="I/O">I/O</a></h4><pre>

   Given:

       target1   is the name of the first target body. Both object
                 names and NAIF IDs are accepted. For example, both
                 'Moon' and '301' are accepted.

                 [1,a] = size(target1), char = class(target1)

       shape1    is a string indicating the geometric model used to
                 represent the shape of the first target body.

                 [1,b] = size(shape1), char = class(shape1)

                 The supported options are:

                    'ELLIPSOID'     
   
                       Use a triaxial ellipsoid model with radius values
                       provided via the kernel pool. A kernel variable
                       having a name of the form
      
                          'BODYnnn_RADII'
      
                       where nnn represents the NAIF integer code
                       associated with the body, must be present in the
                       kernel pool. This variable must be associated with
                       three numeric values giving the lengths of the
                       ellipsoid's X, Y, and Z semi-axes.
      
                    'POINT'     
   
                       Treat the body as a single point. When a point
                       target is specified, the occultation conditions
                       can only be total, annular, or none.   
                 
                    'DSK/UNPRIORITIZED[/SURFACES = &lt;surface list&gt;]'
   
                        Use topographic data provided by DSK files to
                        model the body's shape. These data must be
                        provided by loaded DSK files.
   
                        The surface list specification is optional. The
                        syntax of the list is
   
                           &lt;surface 1&gt; [, &lt;surface 2&gt;...]
   
                        If present, it indicates that data only for the
                        listed surfaces are to be used; however, data
                        need not be available for all surfaces in the
                        list. If absent, loaded DSK data for any surface
                        associated with the target body are used.
   
                        The surface list may contain surface names or
                        surface ID codes. Names containing blanks must
                        be delimited by double quotes, for example
   
                           SURFACES = &quot;Mars MEGDR 128 PIXEL/DEG&quot;
   
                        If multiple surfaces are specified, their names
                        or IDs must be separated by commas.
   
                        See the Particulars section below for details
                        concerning use of DSK data.
   
                 The combinations of the shapes of the target bodies
                 `targ1' and `targ2' must be one of:
   
                    One ELLIPSOID, one POINT
                    Two ELLIPSOIDs
                    One DSK, one POINT 

                 Case and leading or trailing blanks are not
                 significant in the string.

       frame1    is the name of the body-fixed, body-centered reference
                 frame associated with the first target body. Examples
                 of such names are 'IAU_SATURN' (for Saturn) and
                 'ITRF93' (for the Earth).

                 [1,c] = size(frame1), char = class(frame1)

                 If the first target body is modeled as a point, 'frame1'
                 should be left blank (Ex: ' ').

                 Case and leading or trailing blanks bracketing a
                 non-blank frame name are not significant in the string.

       target2   is the name of the second target body. See the description
                 of 'target1' above for more details.

                 [1,d] = size(target2), char = class(target2)

       shape2    is the shape specification for the body designated
                 by 'target2'. See the description of 'shape1' above for
                 details.

                 [1,e] = size(shape2), char = class(shape2)

       frame2    is the name of the body-fixed, body-centered reference
                 frame associated with the second target body. See the
                 description of 'frame1' above for more details.

                 [1,f] = size(frame2), char = class(frame2)

       abcorr    indicates the aberration corrections to be applied to
                 the state of each target body to account for one-way
                 light time. Stellar aberration corrections are
                 ignored if specified, since these corrections don't
                 improve the accuracy of the occultation determination.

                 [1,g] = size(abcorr), char = class(abcorr)

                 See the header of the SPICE routine spkezr_c for a
                 detailed description of the aberration correction
                 options. For convenience, the options supported by
                 this routine are listed below:

                    'NONE'     Apply no correction.

                    'LT'       &quot;Reception&quot; case: correct for
                               one-way light time using a Newtonian
                               formulation.

                    'CN'       &quot;Reception&quot; case: converged
                               Newtonian light time correction.

                    'XLT'      &quot;Transmission&quot; case: correct for
                               one-way light time using a Newtonian
                               formulation.

                    'XCN'      &quot;Transmission&quot; case: converged
                               Newtonian light time correction.

                 Case and blanks are not significant in the string
                 'abcorr'.

       observer  is the name of the body from which the occultation
                 is observed. See the description of 'target1' for more
                 details.

                 [1,h] = size(observer), char = class(observer)

       time      is the observation time in seconds past the J2000
                 epoch.

                 [1,n] = size(time), double = class(time)

   the call:

       occult_code = <b>cspice_occult</b> ( target1, shape1,   frame1, ...
                                     target2, shape2,   frame2, ...
                                     abcorr,  observer, time )

   returns:

       occult_code   is an integer occultation code indicating the geometric
                     relationship of the three bodies.

                     [1,n] = size(occult_code), double = class(occult_code)

                     The meaning of the sign of 'occult_code' is given below.

                        Code sign          Meaning
                        ---------          ------------------------------

                                           partially or fully occulted
                                           by the first.

                           &lt; 0             The first ellipsoid is
                                           partially of fully
                                           occulted by the second.

                           = 0             No occultation.

                     Possible 'occult_code' values and meanings are given
                     below. The variable names indicate the type of
                     occultation and which target is in the back. For example,
                     MICE_OCCULT_TOTAL1_BACK represents a total occultation in
                     which the first target is in the back (or occulted by)
                     the second target. The variable names can be used in a
                     program by calling 'MiceUser' as shown in the
                     example program below.

   For many purposes, modeling extended bodies as triaxial
   ellipsoids is adequate for determining whether one body is
   occulted by another as seen from a specified observer.

   Using DSK data
   ==============

      DSK loading and unloading
      -------------------------

      DSK files providing data used by this routine are loaded by
      calling <a href="cspice_furnsh.html">cspice_furnsh</a> and can be unloaded by calling <a href="cspice_unload.html">cspice_unload</a> or
      <a href="cspice_kclear.html">cspice_kclear</a>. See the documentation of <a href="cspice_furnsh.html">cspice_furnsh</a> for limits on
      numbers of loaded DSK files.

      For run-time efficiency, it's desirable to avoid frequent
      loading and unloading of DSK files. When there is a reason to
      use multiple versions of data for a given target body---for
      example, if topographic data at varying resolutions are to be
      used---the surface list can be used to select DSK data to be
      used for a given computation. It is not necessary to unload
      the data that are not to be used. This recommendation presumes
      that DSKs containing different versions of surface data for a
      given body have different surface ID codes.


      DSK data priority
      -----------------

      A DSK coverage overlap occurs when two segments in loaded DSK
      files cover part or all of the same domain---for example, a
      given longitude-latitude rectangle---and when the time
      intervals of the segments overlap as well.

      When DSK data selection is prioritized, in case of a coverage
      overlap, if the two competing segments are in different DSK
      files, the segment in the DSK file loaded last takes
      precedence. If the two segments are in the same file, the
      segment located closer to the end of the file takes
      precedence.

      When DSK data selection is unprioritized, data from competing
      segments are combined. For example, if two competing segments
      both represent a surface as a set of triangular plates, the
      union of those sets of plates is considered to represent the
      surface.

      Currently only unprioritized data selection is supported.
      Because prioritized data selection may be the default behavior
      in a later version of the routine, the UNPRIORITIZED keyword is
      required in the `shape1' and `shape2' arguments.


      Syntax of the shape input arguments for the DSK case
      ----------------------------------------------------

      The keywords and surface list in the target shape arguments
      `shape1' and `shape2' are called &quot;clauses.&quot; The clauses may
      appear in any order, for example

         'DSK/&lt;surface list&gt;/UNPRIORITIZED'
         'DSK/UNPRIORITIZED/&lt;surface list&gt;'
         'UNPRIORITIZED/&lt;surface list&gt;/DSK'

      The simplest form of the `method' argument specifying use of
      DSK data is one that lacks a surface list, for example:

         'DSK/UNPRIORITIZED'

      For applications in which all loaded DSK data for the target
      body are for a single surface, and there are no competing
      segments, the above string suffices. This is expected to be
      the usual case.

      When, for the specified target body, there are loaded DSK
      files providing data for multiple surfaces for that body, the
      surfaces to be used by this routine for a given call must be
      specified in a surface list, unless data from all of the
      surfaces are to be used together.

      The surface list consists of the string

         'SURFACES = '

      followed by a comma-separated list of one or more surface
      identifiers. The identifiers may be names or integer codes in
      string format. For example, suppose we have the surface
      names and corresponding ID codes shown below:

         Surface Name                              ID code
         ------------                              -------
         &quot;Mars MEGDR 128 PIXEL/DEG&quot;                1
         &quot;Mars MEGDR 64 PIXEL/DEG&quot;                 2
         &quot;Mars_MRO_HIRISE&quot;                         3

      If data for all of the above surfaces are loaded, then
      data for surface 1 can be specified by either

         'SURFACES = 1'

      or

         'SURFACES = &quot;Mars MEGDR 128 PIXEL/DEG&quot;'

      Double quotes are used to delimit the surface name because
      it contains blank characters.

      To use data for surfaces 2 and 3 together, any
      of the following surface lists could be used:

         'SURFACES = 2, 3'

         'SURFACES = &quot;Mars MEGDR  64 PIXEL/DEG&quot;, 3'

         'SURFACES = 2, Mars_MRO_HIRISE'

         'SURFACES = &quot;Mars MEGDR 64 PIXEL/DEG&quot;, Mars_MRO_HIRISE'

      An example of a shape argument that could be constructed
      using one of the surface lists above is

         'DSK/UNPRIORITIZED/SURFACES = &quot;Mars MEGDR 64 PIXEL/DEG&quot;, 3'
