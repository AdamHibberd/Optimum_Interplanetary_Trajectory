%-I/O
%
%   Given:
%
%      q   an array of unit-length SPICE-style quaternion(s).
%
%          [4,n] = size(q); double = class(q)
%
%          Note that multiple styles of quaternions are in use.
%          This routine returns a quaternion that conforms to
%          the SPICE convention. See the Particulars section
%          for details.
%
%   the call:
%
%      r = cspice_q2m(q)
%
%   returns:
%
%      r   the rotation matrix/matrices corresponding to 'q'
%
%          If [4,1] = size(q) then [3,3]   = size(r)
%          If [4,n] = size(q) then [3,3,n] = size(r)
%                                   double = class(r)
%
%-Examples
%
%   Any numerical results shown for this example may differ between
%   platforms as the results depend on the SPICE kernels used as input
%   and the machine specific arithmetic implementation.

%-Particulars
%
%   About SPICE quaternions
%   =======================
%
%   There are (at least) two popular "styles" of quaternions; these
%   differ in the layout of the quaternion elements, the definition
%   of the multiplication operation, and the mapping between the set
%   of unit quaternions and corresponding rotation matrices.
%
%   SPICE-style quaternions have the scalar part in the first
%   component and the vector part in the subsequent components. The
%   SPICE convention, along with the multiplication rules for SPICE
%   quaternions, are those used by William Rowan Hamilton, the
%   inventor of quaternions.
%
%   Another common quaternion style places the scalar component
%   last.  This style is often used in engineering applications.
