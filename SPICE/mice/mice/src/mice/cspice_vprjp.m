%-I/O
%
%   Given:
%
%      vin     the vector to orthogonally project onto a specified plane.
%
%              [3,1] = size(vin); double = class(vin)
%
%      plane   a structure describing a SPICE plane onto which to
%              project 'vin'.
%
%              [1,1] = size(plane); struct = class(plane)
%
%              The structure has the fields:
%
%                 normal:     [3,1] = size(normal); double = class(normal)
%                 constant:   [1,1] = size(constant); double = class(constant)
%
%   the call:
%
%      vout = cspice_vprjp( vin, plane )
%
%   returns:
%
%      vout   the vector resulting from the orthogonal projection of 'vin'
%             onto 'plane'. 'vout' is the closest point in the specified
%             plane to 'vin'.
%
%             [3,1] = size(vout); double = class(vout)
%
%-Examples
%
%   Any numerical results shown for this example may differ between
%   platforms as the results depend on the SPICE kernels used as input
%   and the machine specific arithmetic implementation.
%
%      %
%      % Find the closest point in the ring plane of a planet to a
%      % spacecraft located at vec1 (in body-fixed coordinates).
%      %
%      vec1 = [ -5., 7., 2.2]';
%
%      %
%      % Define the vector normal as the normal to the
%      % equatorial ring plane, and the origin at body/ring center
%      %
%      norm = [ 0., 0., 1. ]';
%      orig = [ 0., 0., 0. ]';
%
%      %
%      % Create the plane structure.
%      %
%      ring_plane = cspice_nvp2pl( norm, orig );
%
%      %
%      % Project the position vector onto the ring plane...
%      %
%      proj = cspice_vprjp( vec1, ring_plane )
%
%   MATLAB outputs:
%
%      proj =
%
%          -5
%           7
%           0
%
%-Particulars
%
%   Projecting a vector v orthogonally onto a plane can be thought of
%   as finding the closest vector in the plane to v.  This `closest
%   vector' always exists; it may be coincident with the original
%   vector.
%
%   Two related routines are cspice_vprjpi, which inverts an orthogonal
%   projection of a vector onto a plane, and cspice_vproj, which projects
%   a vector orthogonally onto another vector.
