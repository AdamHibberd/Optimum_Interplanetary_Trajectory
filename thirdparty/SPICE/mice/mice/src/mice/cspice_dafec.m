%-I/O
%
%   Given:
%
%      handle   file handle referring to a DAF file.
%
%               [1,1] = size(handle); int32 = class(handle)
%
%      bufsiz   the maximum number of comment lines to copy to 'buffer'.
%
%               [1,1] = size(bufsiz); int32 = class(bufsiz)
%
%      lenout   allowed length of each string element of the output 'buffer'.
%               This length must be large enough to hold the longest output
%               string. The SPICE system imposes no limit on the length of
%               comment lines, so 'lenout' normally should be set to a
%               "generous" value that is unlikely to be exceeded.
%
%               [1,1] = size(lenout); int32 = class(lenout)
%
%   the call:
%
%      [buffer, done] = cspice_dafec( handle, bufsiz, lenout )
%
%   returns:
%
%      buffer   array containing the comment lines read from the DAF
%               associated with 'handle'.
%
%               On output, 'buffer' contains 'bufsiz' or less strings of comment
%               text, with one comment line per string ( bufsiz >= n).
%
%               [n,c1] = size(buffer); char = class(buffer)
%
%      done     logical indicating whether or not all of the comment
%               lines from the comment area of the DAF have been read. This
%               variable has value true after the last comment line has been
%               read. It will have a false value otherwise.
%
%               If no comments exist in the comment area, this variable
%               returns as true.
%
%               [1,1] = size(done); logical = class(done)
%
%-Examples
%
%   Any numerical results shown for this example may differ between
%   platforms as the results depend on the SPICE kernels used as input
%   and the machine specific arithmetic implementation.
%
%      %
%      % Define an SPK from which to extract the comment area.
%      %
%      SPK        = 'de421.bsp';
%
%      %
%      % Define the size of the comment area to read from the SPK.
%      % 15 lines, each with length 80 characters.
%      %
%      BUFSIZE    = 15;
%      LINLEN     = 80;
%
%      %
%      % Open the 'SPK' for reading, return the corresponding
%      % file handle to 'handle'.
%      %
%      handle = cspice_dafopr( SPK );
%
%      done = false;
%
%      [buf, done] = cspice_dafec( handle, BUFSIZE, LINLEN );
%      output = cellstr(buf);
%
%      for i=1:numel(output)
%         fprintf( '%s\n', char(output(i)) );
%      end
%
%      if done
%         fprintf( 'All comments read from file.\n' );
%      else
%         fprintf( 'Not all comments read from file.\n' );
%      end
%
%      %
%      % SAFELY close the file.
%      %
%      cspice_dafcls( handle )
%
%   Matlab outputs:
%
%      ; de421.bsp LOG FILE
%      ;
%      ; Created 2008-02-12/11:33:34.00.
%      ;
%      ; BEGIN NIOSPK COMMANDS
%
%      LEAPSECONDS_FILE    = naif0007.tls
%      SPK_FILE            = de421.bsp
%        SPK_LOG_FILE      = de421_spk_conversion.log

%
%      ; END NIOSPK COMMANDS
%
%      Not all comments read from file.
%
%   The program outputs BUFSIZ (15) lines from the 'SPK' comment area.
%   Additional calls to cspice_dafec will read more comment lines
%   from the SPK in slices of BUFSIZ.
%
%   Reading all comment lines from 'SPK' requires a large value for BUFSIZ.
%   In this case, a BUFSIZ value of 50 will read all comment lines from
%   'SPK' in a single cspice_dafec.
%
%-Particulars
%
%   A binary DAF contains an area which is reserved for storing
%   annotations or descriptive textual information describing the data
%   contained in a file. This area is referred to as the ``comment
%   area'' of the file. The comment area of a DAF is a line
%   oriented medium for storing textual information. The comment
%   area preserves any leading or embedded white space in the line(s)
%   of text which are stored, so that the appearance of the of
%   information will be unchanged when it is retrieved (extracted) at
%   some other time. Trailing blanks, however, are NOT preserved,
%   due to the way that character strings are represented in
%   standard Fortran 77.
%
%   This routine will read the comments from the comment area of
%   a binary DAF, placing them into a line buffer. If the line
%   buffer is not large enough to hold the entire comment area,
%   the portion read will be returned to the caller, and the DONE
%   flag will be set to false. This allows the comment area to be
%   read in ``chunks,'' a buffer at a time. After all of the comment
%   lines have been read, the `done' flag will be set to true.
%
%   This routine can be used to ``simultaneously'' extract comments
%   from the comment areas of multiple binary DAFs.
