%-I/O
%
%   Given:
%
%      a   the vector(s) to project onto the vector(s) 'b'.
%
%          [3,n] = size(a); double = class(a)
%
%      b   the vector(s) to receive the projection(s).
%
%          [3,n] = size(b); double = class(b)
%
%      An implicit assumption exists that 'a' and 'b' are specified
%      in the same reference frame. If this is not the case, the numerical
%      result has no meaning.
%
%   the call:
%
%      vproj = cspice_vproj( a, b )
%
%   returns:
%
%      vproj   vector containing the projection(s) of 'a' onto 'b' ('vproj' is
%              necessarily parallel to 'b'.)  If 'b' equals the zero vector
%              then the zero vector will return as 'vproj'.
%
%              [3,n] = size(vproj); double = class(vproj)
%
%             'vproj' returns with the same vectorization measure, N, as
%             'a' and 'b'
%
%-Examples
%
%   Any numerical results shown for this example may differ between
%   platforms as the results depend on the SPICE kernels used as input
%   and the machine specific arithmetic implementation.
%
%      %
%      % Define two vector sets.
%      %
%      a = [ [ 6, 6, 6]', ...
%            [ 6, 6, 6]', ...
%            [ 6, 6, 0]', ...
%            [ 6, 0, 0]' ]
%
%      b = [ [ 2, 0, 0]', ...
%            [-3, 0, 0]', ...
%            [ 0, 7, 0]', ...
%            [ 0, 0, 9]' ]
%
%      %
%      % Calculate the projection.
%      %
%      p = cspice_vproj( a, b )
%
%   MATLAB outputs:
%
%      a =
%
%           6     6     6     6
%           6     6     6     0
%           6     6     0     0
%
%
%      b =
%
%           2    -3     0     0
%           0     0     7     0
%           0     0     0     9
%
%
%      p =
%
%           6     6     0     0
%           0     0     6     0
