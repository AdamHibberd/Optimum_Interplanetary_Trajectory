%-I/O
%
%   Given:
%
%      which   index of the kernel to fetch (matching the type specified by
%              kind) from the list of kernels loaded using cspice_furnsh but
%              not unloaded using cspice_unload or cleared by cspice_klear.
%
%              [1,1] = size(which); int32 = class(which)
%
%              The range of 'which' is 1 to 'count', where 'count' is
%              the number of kernels loaded via cspice_furnsh. Retrieve
%              this value from a cspice_ktotal call.  See the
%              Examples section for an illustrative code fragment.
%
%     kind     list of types of kernels to consider when fetching kernels from
%              the list of loaded kernels.
%
%              [1,c1] = size(kind), char = class(kind)
%
%                 or
%
%              [1,1] = size(kind), cell = class(kind)
%
%              'kind' should consist of a list of words of kernels to
%              examine. Recognized types are
%
%                 'SPK'  --- All SPK files are counted in the total.
%                 'CK'   --- All CK files are counted in the total.
%                 'PCK'  --- All binary PCK files are counted in the
%                          total.
%                 'DSK'  --- All DSK files are counted in the total.
%                 'EK'   --- All EK files are counted in the total.
%                 'TEXT' --- All text kernels that are not meta-text
%                          kernels are included in the total.
%                 'META' --- All meta-text kernels are counted in the
%                          total.
%                 'ALL'  --- Every type of kernel is counted in the
%                          total.
%
%              'kind' lacks case sensitivity. The cspice_kdata algorithm
%              ignores words in 'kind' if not one of those listed above.
%
%              See the routine cspice_ktotal for example use 'kind'.
%
%   the call:
%
%      [file, filtyp, source, handle, found] = cspice_kdata(which, kind)
%
%   returns:
%
%      file     name of the file having index 'which' in the sequence of files
%               of type 'kind' currently loaded via cspice_furnsh. 'file'
%               returns empty if no loaded kernels match the specification of
%               'which' and 'kind'.
%
%               [1,m] = size(file); char = class(file)
%
%      filtyp   name of the type of kernel specified by 'file'. 'filtyp' will
%               be empty if no loaded kernels match the specification of
%               'which' and 'kind'.
%
%               [1,m] = size(filtyp); char = class(filtyp)
%
%      source   name of the source file used to specify file as one to load. If
%               file was loaded directly via a call to cspice_furnsh, 'source'
%               will be empty. If there is no file matching the specification
%               of which and kind, 'source' will be empty.
%
%               [1,m] = size(source); char = class(source)
%
%      handle   handle attached to file if it is a binary kernel.  If file is a
%               text kernel or meta-text kernel handle will be zero.  If there
%               is no file matching the specification of 'which' and 'kind',
%               'handle' will be set to zero.
%
%               [1,1] = size(handle); int32 = class(handle)
%
%      found    flag indicating if a file matching the specification of 'which'
%               and 'kind' exists. If there no such file exists, 'found'
%               returns false (if 'found' returns as false, all return strings
%               are empty, not null).
%
%               [1,1] = size(found); logical = class(found)
%
%-Examples
%
%   Any numerical results shown for this example may differ between
%   platforms as the results depend on the SPICE kernels used as input
%   and the machine specific arithmetic implementation.
%
%      Use the meta-kernel shown below to load the required SPICE
%      kernels.
%
%         KPL/MK
%
%         File name: standard.tm
%
%         This meta-kernel is intended to support operation of SPICE
%         example programs. The kernels shown here should not be
%         assumed to contain adequate or correct versions of data
%         required by SPICE-based user applications.
%
%         In order for an application to use this meta-kernel, the
%         kernels referenced here must be present in the user's
%         current working directory.
%
%         The names and contents of the kernels referenced
%         by this meta-kernel are as follows:
