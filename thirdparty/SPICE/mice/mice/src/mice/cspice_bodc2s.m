%-Abstract
%
%   CSPICE_BODC2S translates a body ID code to either the corresponding name
%   or if no name to ID code mapping exists, the string representation of
%   the body ID value.

%
%-I/O
%
%   Given:
%
%      code   SPICE code(s) for a set of bodies: planets, satellites,
%             barycenters, DSN stations, spacecraft, asteroids, comets,
%             or other ephemeris object.
%
%             [1,n] = size(code); int32 = class(code)
%
%   the call:
%
%      [name] = cspice_bodc2s( code )
%
%   returns:
%
%      name   the name(s) corresponding to 'code' if a mapping between
%             'code' and a body name exists within SPICE, assigned either
%             in SPICE or by the user.
%
%             [n,c2] = size(name); char = class(name)
%
%             If 'code' has more than one translation, then the most recently
%             defined 'name' corresponding to 'code' is returned. 'name' will
%             have the exact format (case and blanks) as when the name/code pair
%             was defined.
%
%             If the input value of 'code' does not map to a body name, 'name'
%             returns with the string representation of 'code'.
%
%             'name' returns with the same vectorization measure (N) as 'code'.
%
%-Examples
%
%   Any numerical results shown for this example may differ between
%   platforms as the results depend on the SPICE kernels used as input
%   and the machine specific arithmetic implementation.
%
%      %
%      % Assign an array of body ID codes. Not all the listed codes
%      % map to a body name.
%      %
%      code = [ 399, 0, 3, -77, 11, -1, 6000001 ];
%
%      name = cspice_bodc2s( code );
%
%      for i=1:7
%         fprintf( '%8d  %s\n', code(i), name(i,:) )
%      end
%
%   MATLAB outputs:
%
%          399  EARTH
%            0  SOLAR SYSTEM BARYCENTER
%            3  EARTH BARYCENTER
%          -77  GALILEO ORBITER
%           11  11
%           -1  GEOTAIL
%      6000001  6000001
%
%-Particulars
%
%   A sister version of this routine exists named mice_bodc2n that returns
%   the output arguments as fields in a single structure.
%
%   cspice_bodc2n is one of five related subroutines,
%
%      cspice_bods2c      Body string to code
%      cspice_bodc2s      Body code to string
%      cspice_bodn2c      Body name to code
%      cspice_bodc2n      Body code to name
%      cspice_boddef      Body name/code definition
%
%   cspice_bods2c, cspice_bodc2s, cspice_bodn2c, and cspice_bodc2n
%   perform translations between body names and their corresponding
%   integer ID codes which are used in SPICE files and routines.
%
%   cspice_bods2c is a slightly more general version of cspice_bodn2c:
%   support for strings containing ID codes in string format enables a caller
%   to identify a body using a string, even when no name is associated with
%   that body.
%
%   cspice_bodc2s is a general version of cspice_bodc2n; the routine returns
%   either the name assigned in the body ID to name mapping or a string
%   representation of the 'code' value if no mapping exists.
%
%   cspice_boddef assigns a body name to ID mapping. The mapping has
%   priority in name-to-ID and ID-to-name translations.
%
%   Refer to NAIF_IDS.REQ for the list of name/code associations built
%   into SPICE, and for details concerning adding new name/code
%   associations at run time by loading text kernels.
