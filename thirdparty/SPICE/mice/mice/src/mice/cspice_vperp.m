%
%-I/O
%
%   Given:
%
%      a   the vector(s) whose component orthogonal to 'b' is sought.
%
%          [3,n] = size(a); double = class(a)
%
%          (There is a unique decomposition of a into a sum v + p, where v is
%          parallel to b and p is orthogonal to b.  We want the component p.)
%
%      b   the second vector(s) used as a reference for the decomposition
%          of 'a'.
%
%          [3,n] = size(b); double = class(b)
%
%      An implicit assumption exists that 'a' and 'b' are specified
%      in the same reference frame. If this is not the case, the numerical
%      result has no meaning.
%
%   the call:
%
%      vperp = cspice_vperp( a, b )
%
%   returns:
%
%      vperp   the 3-vector(s) containing the component of 'a' orthogonal
%              to 'b'.
%
%              [3,n] = size(vperp); double = class(vperp)
%
%             'vperp' returns with the same vectorization measure, N, as
%             'a' and 'b'
%
%-Examples
%
%   Any numerical results shown for this example may differ between
%   platforms as the results depend on the SPICE kernels used as input
%   and the machine specific arithmetic implementation.
%
%      %
%      % Define two vector sets.
%      %
%      a = [ [ 6, 6, 6]', ...
%            [ 6, 6, 6]', ...
%            [ 6, 6, 0]', ...
%            [ 6, 0, 0]' ]
%
%      b = [ [ 2, 0, 0]', ...
%            [-3, 0, 0]', ...
%            [ 0, 7, 0]', ...
%            [ 0, 0, 9]' ]
%
%      %
%      % Calculate the decomposition.
%      %
%      p = cspice_vperp( a, b )
%
%   MATLAB outputs:
%
%      a =
%
%           6     6     6     6
%           6     6     6     0
%           6     6     0     0
%
%
%      b =
%
%           2    -3     0     0
%           0     0     7     0
%           0     0     0     9
%
%
%      p =
%
%           0     0     6     6
%           6     6     0     0
