   Deprecated: This routine has been superseded by the CSPICE routine
   <a href="cspice_subpnt.html">cspice_subpnt</a>. This routine is supported for purposes of backward
   compatibility only.

   CSPICE_SUBPT_PL02 returns the rectangular coordinates of the sub-observer
   point on a target body at a particular epoch, optionally corrected for
   light time and stellar aberration.  The target body's surface is
   represented by a triangular plate model contained in a type 2 DSK
   segment. Return the sub-observer point's coordinates expressed in the
   body-fixed frame associated with the target body.  Also, return the
   observer's altitude above the target body.

</pre><h4><a name="I/O">I/O</a></h4><pre>

   Given:

      handle      is DAS file handle of a DSK file open for read
                  access.  This kernel must contain a type 2 segment
                  that provides a plate model representing the entire
                  surface of the target body.

                  [1,1] = size(handle); int32 = class(handle)

      dladsc      is DLA descriptor of a DSK segment representing
                  the surface of the target body.

                 [SPICE_DLA_DSCSIZ,1]  = size(dladsc)
                                 int32 = class(dladsc)

      method      a short string specifying the computation method
                  to be used.

                  [1,c1] = size(method); char = class(method)

                     or

                  [1,1] = size(method); cell = class(method)

                  The choices are:

                      'Intercept'       The sub-observer point is defined as
                                        the plate model surface intercept of
                                        the ray starting at the observer and
                                         passing through the target's center.

                     'Ellipsoid
                      near point'       The sub-observer point is defined
                                        as the plate model surface
                                        intercept of the ray starting at
                                        the observer and passing through
                                        the nearest point to the observer
                                        on a reference ellipsoid
                                        associated with the target body.

                                        This option requires that the
                                        reference ellipsoid's radii be
                                        available in the kernel pool.

                  For both computation methods, this routine finds a
                  sub-point on the same side of the target body as the
                  observer.  If the observer is inside the target body,
                  the 'sub-point' will actually be above the observer.
                  In the case of multiple intercepts, the outermost one
                  (that is, the one farthest from the target center) is
                  selected.

                  Neither case nor white space are significant in the
                  string 'method'.  For example, the string

                     '  ellipsoidNEARPOINT'

                  is valid.

      target      is name of the target body.  `target' is
                  case-insensitive, and leading and trailing blanks in
                  `target' are not significant. Optionally, you may supply
                  a string containing the integer ID code for the object.
                  For example both 'MOON' and '301' are legitimate strings
                  that indicate the moon is the target body.

                  This routine assumes that the target body's surface is
                  represented by a plate model, and that a DSK file
                  containing the plate model has been loaded via dasopr_c.

                  [1,c2] = size(target); char = class(target)

                     or

                  [1,1] = size(target); cell = class(target)

      et          is epoch, represented  as seconds past J2000 TDB, at
                  which the sub-observer point on the target body is to be
                  computed.  When aberration corrections are used, `et'
                  refers to the epoch at which radiation is received at
                  the observer.

                  [1,1] = size(et); double = class(et)

      abcorr      indicates the aberration corrections to be applied to
                  the position and orientation of the target body to
                  account for one-way light time and stellar aberration.
                  See the discussion in the Particulars section for
                  recommendations on how to choose aberration corrections.

                  [1,c3] = size(abcorr); char = class(abcorr)

                     or

                  [1,1] = size(abcorr); cell = class(abcorr)

                  `abcorr' may be any of the following:

                     'NONE'     Apply no correction. Use the geometric
                                position of the target body relative to
                                the observer; evaluate the target body's
                                orientation at `et'.

                  The following values of `abcorr' apply to the
                  'reception' case in which photons depart from the
                  target's location at the light-time corrected epoch
                  et-lt and *arrive* at the observer's location at
                  `et':

                     'LT'       Correct for one-way light time (also
                                called &quot;planetary aberration&quot;) using a
                                Newtonian formulation. This correction
                                uses the position and orientation of the
                                target at the moment it emitted photons
                                arriving at the observer at `et'.

                                The light time correction uses an
                                iterative solution of the light time
                                equation (see Particulars for details).
                                The solution invoked by the 'LT' option
                                uses one iteration.

                     'LT+S'     Correct for one-way light time and stellar
                                aberration using a Newtonian formulation.
                                This option modifies the position obtained
                                with the 'LT' option to account for the
                                observer's velocity relative to the solar
                                system barycenter. The result is the
                                sub-observer point computed using the
                                apparent position and orientation of the
                                target as seen by the observer.

                     'CN'       Converged Newtonian light time
                                correction.  In solving the light time
                                equation, the 'CN' correction iterates
                                until the solution converges (three
                                iterations on all supported platforms).

                     'CN+S'     Converged Newtonian light time
                                and stellar aberration corrections.


      obsrvr      is name of the observing body.  This is typically a
                  spacecraft, the earth, or a surface point on the earth.
                  `obsrvr' is case-insensitive, and leading and trailing
                  blanks in `obsrvr' are not significant. Optionally, you
                  may supply a string containing the integer ID code for
                  the object.  For example both 'EARTH' and '399' are
                  legitimate strings that indicate the earth is the
                  observer.

                  [1,c4] = size(obsrvr); char = class(obsrvr)

                     or

                  [1,1] = size(obsrvr); cell = class(obsrvr)

   the call:

      [spoint, alt, plateid] =                              ...
                 <b>cspice_subpt_pl02</b>( handle, dladsc, method, ...
                                    target, et,     abcorr, ...
                                    obsrvr )

   returns:

      spoint      is sub-observer point on the target body expressed
                  relative to the body-fixed reference frame of the target
                  body.

                  [3,1] = size(spoint); double = class(spoint)

                  The definition of sub-observer point depends on the
                  selected computation method.  See the description of the
                  input argument `method' for details.

                  The target body-fixed frame, which is time-dependent, is
                  evaluated at `et' if `abcorr' is 'NONE'; otherwise the
                  frame is evaluated at et-lt, where `lt' is the one-way
                  light time from target to observer.

                  The position and orientation of the target body are
                  corrected for aberration as specified by `abcorr'; the
                  corrected position and orientation are used in the
                  computation of `spoint'.

      alt         is signed distance between the observer and the
                  sub-point.  When the observer is outside the body
                  `alt' is positive; when the observer is inside, `alt'
                  is negative.

                  [1,1] = size(alt); double = class(alt)

                  Note that `alt' is not truly an `altitude' unless the
                  observer-to-sub-point vector happens to be perpendicular
                  to the target body's surface at the sub-point.  In
                  general this condition should not be expected to hold,
                  unless the plate model representation of the target
                  body's surface very nearly matches the target body's
                  reference ellipsoid and the 'ellipsoid near point'
                  computation method is selected.

      plateID     is integer ID code of the plate on which the
                  sub-observer point is located.  This ID code can be
                  use to look up data associated with the plate, such
                  as the plate's vertices or outward normal vector.

                  [1,1] = size(plateID); int32 = class(plateID)

   Any numerical results shown for this example may differ between
   platforms as the results depend on the SPICE kernels used as input
   and the machine specific arithmetic implementation.

   Find the sub-observer point on Phobos as seen from Earth for a
   specified sequence of times. Perform the computation twice,
   using both the &quot;intercept&quot; and &quot;ellipsoid near point&quot;
   options. Compute the corresponding sub-subobserver point values
   using an ellipsoidal surface for comparison.

   In the following example program, the file

      phobos_3_3.dsk

   is a DSK file containing a type 2 segment that provides a plate model
   representation of the surface of Phobos. The file

      mar097.bsp

   is a binary SPK file containing data for Phobos, the Earth, and the
   Sun for a time interval bracketing the date

      2006 NOV 3 00:00:00 UTC.

   pck00010.tpc is a planetary constants kernel file containing radii

   <b>cspice_subpt_pl02</b> computes the sub-observer point (abbreviated as
   &quot;sub-point&quot;) on a target body. <b>cspice_subpt_pl02</b> also determines the
   distance from the observer to the sub-observer point.

   Sub-point Definitions
   =====================

   This routine offers two ways of defining the sub-point:

      - The 'intercept' method. In general, this definition
        calls for defining a ray emanating from the observer and
        passing through the center of the target body.  The intercept
        on the first plate (the one closest to the observer) hit by this
        ray is the sub-point.

        The details of this definition are a bit more complex, because
        this routine handles the case where the observer is inside the
        target.  In such cases, the sub-point is actually the point
        that would be obtained by scaling up the target center-
        observer vector so as to place the observer outside the target,
        then computing the sub-point in the usual way.  This handling
        of the interior observer case prevents an observer location
        that is slightly below the surface from accidentally being
        associated with a sub-point on the opposite side of the target.
        However, the possibility that the &quot;sub-point&quot; may be &quot;above&quot;
        the observer may seem counterintuitive.

      - The 'ellipsoid near point' method.  When a target's surface is
        modeled by a set of triangular plates, the notion of &quot;dropping
        a perpendicular segment to the surface,&quot; which makes sense
        for convex surfaces, becomes problematic:  there need not be
        any plate whose normal vector is parallel to a segment from
        the observer to some point on that plate, or there could be
        more than one such plate.  If such a plate exists, it might
        be located anywhere on the visible surface---not necessarily
        &quot;below&quot; the observer.

        To work around these problems, the ellipsoid near point method
        uses a reference ellipsoid to define a preliminary sub-point:
        for an exterior observer, this is the unique point on the
        ellipsoid's surface at which the outward surface normal points
        toward the observer.  Then the plate model sub-point is defined
        as the plate intercept closest to the observer of a ray
        emanating from the observer and passing through the preliminary
        sub-point on the ellipsoid.

   For a large target such as Mars, or for any target whose reference
   ellipsoid deviates significantly from spherical, the results
   obtained using the two sub-point definitions can be quite different.
   The example program provided below demonstrates this fact; Phobos is
   the target body in this case.  Some analysis on the user's part will
   be needed to select the &quot;best&quot; definition for a given application.

   When comparing sub-point computations with results from sources
   other than SPICE, it's essential to make sure the same geometric
   definitions are used.


   Aberration Corrections
   ======================

   Below, we indicate the aberration corrections to use for some
   common applications:

      1) Compute the sub-observer point using the apparent direction
         and orientation of a target. This is the most common case for
         a remote-sensing observation.  When the observer's altitude
         is more than one target radius above the surface:

            Use 'CN+S':  apply both converged light time and stellar
            aberration corrections.

         Note that when the observer is close to the target surface,
         this choice may yield inaccurate results, since light time is
         measured between the observer and the target center.  When the
         observer has altitude of less than one target radius above the
         surface, aberration corrections should be omitted, so in this
         case abcorr should be set to:

            'NONE'

      2) Use a geometric position vector and uncorrected target
         orientation as low-accuracy estimates for an application where
         execution speed is critical.

            Use 'NONE'.

   See the header of the CSPICE routine spkezr_c for a detailed
   discussion of aberration corrections.
