%-Abstract
%
%   CSPICE_NPELPT calculates the location on an ellipse closest
%   to a specified point, both in three-dimensional space,
%   and the distance between the ellipse and the point.

%-I/O
%
%   Given:
%
%      point     a 3-vector defining a location in 3-dimensional space.
%
%                [3,1] = size(point); double = class(point)
%
%      ellipse   a SPICE ellipse.
%
%                [1,1] = size(ellipse); struct = class(ellipse)
%
%                The structure has the fields:
%
%                center:    [3,1] = size(center); double = class(center)
%                semiMinor: [3,1] = size(semiMinor); double = class(semiMinor)
%                semiMajor: [3,1] = size(semiMajor); double = class(semiMajor)
%
%   the call:
%
%      [ pnear, dist ] = cspice_npelpt( point, ellipse )
%
%   returns:
%
%      pnear   the 3-vector defining the location on the ellipse nearest
%              to 'point'.
%
%              [3,1] = size(point); double = class(point)
%
%      dist    the distance between the calculated point 'pnear' 
%              and 'point'.
%
%              dist = || pnear - point ||
%
%              [1,1] = size(dist); double = class(dist)
%
%-Examples
%
%   Any numerical results shown for this example may differ between
%   platforms as the results depend on the SPICE kernels used as input
%   and the machine specific arithmetic implementation.
%
%-Particulars
%
%   Given an ellipse and a point in 3-dimensional space, if the
%   orthogonal projection of the point onto the plane of the ellipse
%   is on or outside of the ellipse, then there is a unique point on
%   the ellipse closest to the original point.  This routine finds
%   that nearest point on the ellipse.  If the projection falls inside
%   the ellipse, there may be multiple points on the ellipse that are
%   at the minimum distance from the original point.  In this case,
%   one such closest point will be returned.
%
%   This routine returns a distance, rather than an altitude, in
%   contrast to the Mice routine cspice_nearpt.  Because our ellipse is
%   situated in 3-space and not 2-space, the input point is not
%   `inside' or `outside' the ellipse, so the notion of altitude does
%   not apply to the problem solved by this routine.  In the case of
%   cspice_nearpt, the input point is on, inside, or outside the ellipsoid,
%   so it makes sense to speak of its altitude.
