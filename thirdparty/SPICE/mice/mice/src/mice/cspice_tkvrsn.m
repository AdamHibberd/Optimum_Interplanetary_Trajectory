%-I/O
%
%   Given:
%
%      item   the item name for which to return the version string.
%
%             [1,c1] = size(item); char = class(item)
%
%                or
%
%             [1,1] = size(item); cell = class(item)
%
%             Currently, the only item supported is "toolkit"
%             and it will return the toolkit version number.
%
%             Any other 'item' will return "No version found."
%
%   the call:
%
%      value = cspice_tkvrsn( item )
%
%   returns:
%
%      value   latest version string for the specified 'item'.
%
%              [1,c2] = size(value); double = class(value)
%
%-Examples
%
%   Any numerical results shown for this example may differ between
%   platforms as the results depend on the SPICE kernels used as input
%   and the machine specific arithmetic implementation.
%
%      >> disp( cspice_tkvrsn('toolkit') )
%
%   MATLAB outputs:
%
%      CSPICE_N0060
%
%-Particulars
%
%   None.
%
%-Required Reading
