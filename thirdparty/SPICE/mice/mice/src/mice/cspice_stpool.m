%-Abstract
%
%   CSPICE_STPOOL retrieves the 'nth' string from the kernel pool variable
%   'item' , where the string may be continued across several components
%   of the kernel pool variable.

%
%-I/O
%
%   Given:
%
%      item     the name of a kernel pool variable for which the caller
%               wants to retrieve a full (potentially continued) string.
%
%               [1,c1] = size(item); char = class(item)
%
%                  or
%
%               [1,1] = size(item); cell = class(item)
%
%      nth      the index of the string to retrieve from the kernel pool
%               variable 'item' (index array base 1).
%
%               [1,1]   = size(nth); int32 = class(nth)
%
%      contin   a sequence of characters which (if they appear as the
%               last non-blank sequence of characters in a component of a
%               value of a kernel pool variable) act as a continuation
%               marker:  the marker indicates that the string associated
%               with the component containing it is continued into the
%               next literal component of the kernel pool variable
%
%               [1,c2] = size(contin); char = class(contin)
%
%                  or
%
%               [1,1] = size(contin); cell = class(contin)
%
%               If 'contin' is a blank, all of the components of 'item'
%               will return as a single string.
%
%   the call:
%
%      [string, found] = cspice_stpool( item, nth, contin )
%
%   returns:
%
%      string   the 'nth' scalar string value corresponding to
%               the kernel pool variable specified by 'item'
%
%               [1,c3] = size(string); char = class(string)
%
%      found    a boolean indicating true if the request
%               to retrieve the 'nth' string associated with 'item'
%               succeeds, false, if not.
%
%               [1,1] = size(found); logical = class(found)
%
%-Examples
%
%   Any numerical results shown for this example may differ between
%   platforms as the results depend on the SPICE kernels used as input
%   and the machine specific arithmetic implementation.
%
%      %
%      % Load a kernel containing the variable assignment:
%      %
%      % LONG_VAL = ( 'This is part of the first component //'
%      %             'that needs more than one line when //'
%      %             'inserting it into the kernel pool.'
%      %             'This is the second string that is split //'
%      %             'up as several components of a kernel pool //'
%      %             'variable.' )
%      %
%      cspice_furnsh( 'pool_t.ker' )
%
%      %
%      % Retrieve the 'nth' entry for kernel pool variable
%      % 'LONG_VAL' to 'string'.
%      %
%      ITEM   = 'LONG_VAL';
%      CONTIN = '//';
%
%      for nth=1:3
%
%         [string, found] = cspice_stpool( ITEM, nth, CONTIN );
%
%         if ( found )
%
%            fprintf( ['Found index = %d component of kernel variable %s ' ...
%                     'in the kernel pool.\n\n'], nth, ITEM)
%
%            fprintf( 'String = ``%s``\n\n', string )
%
%         else
%
%            fprintf( ['No index = %d component of kernel variable %s ' ...
%                      'found in the kernel pool.\n'], nth, ITEM)
%
%         end
%
%      end
%
%      %
%      % It's always good form to unload kernels after use,
%      % particularly in MATLAB due to data persistence.
%      %
%      cspice_kclear
%
%   MATLAB outputs (approximately):
%
%      Found index = 1 component of kernel variable LONG_VAL in the
%      kernel pool.
%
%      String = ``This is part of the first component that needs more
%      than one line when inserting it into the kernel pool.``
%
%      Found index = 2 component of kernel variable LONG_VAL in the
%      kernel pool.
%
%      String = ``This is the second string that is split up as several
%      components of a kernel pool variable.``
%
%      No index = 3 component of kernel variable LONG_VAL found in the
%      kernel pool.
