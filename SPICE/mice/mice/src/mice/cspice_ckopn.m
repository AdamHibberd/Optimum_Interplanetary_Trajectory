%
%-I/O
%
%   Given:
%
%      fname    the name of the CK file to open.
%
%               [1,c1] = size(fname); char = class(fname)
%
%                  or
%
%               [1,1] = size(fname); cell = class(fname)
%
%      ifname   a descriptive internal filename for the CK.
%
%               [1,m2] = size(ifname); char = class(ifname)
%
%                  or
%
%               [1,1] = size(ifname); cell = class(ifname)
%
%      ncomch   the number of characters to reserve for comments.
%
%               [1,1] = size(ncomch); int32 = class(ncomch)
%
%   the call:
%
%      handle = cspice_ckopn( name, ifname, ncomch )
%
%   returns:
%
%      handle   the file handle assigned to 'fname'
%
%               [1,1] = size(handle); int32 = class(handle)
%
%-Examples
%
%   Any numerical results shown for this example may differ between
%   platforms as the results depend on the SPICE kernels used as input
%   and the machine specific arithmetic implementation.
%
%      %
%      % Define needed parameters, a name for the CK, the
%      % file internal name, and the number of characters
%      % to reserve for a comment block.
%      %
%      CK1        = 'type1.bc';
%      IFNAME     = 'CK';
%      NCOMCH     = 10;
%
%      %
%      % Open a new kernel.
%      %
%       handle = cspice_ckopn( CK1, IFNAME, NCOMCH);
%
%         ... do some writes to the open CK file ...
%
%      %
%      % SAFELY close the file
%      %
%      cspice_ckcls( handle )
%
%-Particulars
%
%   A cspice_ckcls call should balance every cspice_ckopn
%   call.
%
%-Required Reading
