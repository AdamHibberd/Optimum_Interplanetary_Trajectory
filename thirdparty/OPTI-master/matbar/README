To install the MATLAB/BARON interface:
- unzip and place the contents of matbar.zip in a location of your choice;
  this will create a directory named matbar
- in the matbar directory, place your BARON executable and name it barin
  (or barin.exe on Windows platforms)
- run BARON_install from MATLAB
- consult the Help directory, which contains the interface and solver manuals

The above process will give you access to BARON in demo mode.  In order to
run unrestricted in size models, place your BARON license anywhere on the
SYSTEM path or use BARON's licname option to specify the location of your
BARON license file.
