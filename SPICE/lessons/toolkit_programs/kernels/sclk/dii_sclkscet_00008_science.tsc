DII Spacecraft SCLK File, Science Version
===========================================================================
 
     This file is a SPICE spacecraft clock (SCLK) kernel containing
     information required for the Deep Impact Impactor (DII) spacecraft
     on-board clock to UTC conversion.
 
 
Production/History of this SCLK file
--------------------------------------------------------
 
     This file was created on 2006-02-13 for archiving in the Planetary
     Data System.

     This file was generated by the NAIF utility program MAKCLK,
     version 3.5.2, from the final DII spacecraft SCLKvSCET file,
     modified to make impact SCLK time derived from ITS images match
     the impact UTC time provided by the final trajectory solution
     from DI NAV team (see details in ``Particulars'' section of
     these comments.)


Particulars
--------------------------------------------------------

     The input SCLKvSCET file, from which this SCLK kernels was
     generated, was made by changing the rate on the last record of the
     official SCLKvSCET file from 1.000010364 to 1.000009370 to make
     the DII SCLK be 173727875.105 (the impact time as DII SCLK derived
     by Dennis Wellnitz, DI Science Team) at UTC 2005-185T05:44:34.200
     (the impact time in the final trajectory delivered by Dan
     Kubitschek, DI NAV Team.) This change was made solely to achieve
     consistency between the correlation provided by this SCLK and
     final trajectory and is not based on any additional DII time
     correlation data and/or analysis.
      

Usage
--------------------------------------------------------
 
     This file must be loaded into the user's program by a call to the
     FURNSH subroutine
 
          CALL FURNSH( 'this_file_name' )
 
     in order to use the SPICELIB SCLK family of subroutines to convert
     DI spacecraft on-board clock to ET and vice versa.
 
 
SCLK Format
--------------------------------------------------------

     The on-board clock, the conversion for which is provided by this
     SCLK file, consists of two fields:

          SSSSSSSSSS:FFF

     where:

          SSSSSSSSSS -- count of on-board seconds

          FFF        -- count of fractions of a second with one fraction
                        being 1/256 of a second
